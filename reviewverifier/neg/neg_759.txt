I bought this machine on August 3, 2005 and within one week of using it (as an outgoing fax only), there was a machine error.  I called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes I was able to speak with a live representative.  I was told that the machine would need to be replaced.  They sent me a REFURBISHED unit (the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units).  They sent the base unit only, so I had to remove the drum unit, paper tray, and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit.  So, after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit, I was back on hold to report another machine error.  12 minutes and I finally get a rep.  Apparently, the drum unit (which is less than one month old) is bad.  So now I'm waiting for the replacement drum unit.  DON'T EVER BUY A BROTHER MACHINE.  THEY'RE HORRIBLE MACHINES AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY, VERY TIME CONSUMING
