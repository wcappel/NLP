I bought this receiver from Amazon, & received it about 10 days ago.  Since then, I've tried to play my cassettes of classical music.  When used for this purpose, this receiver sucks big time.  If I turn the volume loud enough to hear the orchestra playing softly, when the orchestra gets loud the amp shuts down & PROTECT flashes on & off.  I have to turn the receiver off, then turn it back on, & lower the volume.  Then of course when the music gets soft again, I can't hear it
