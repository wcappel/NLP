CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!

This product does not work as advertised.  If you put more than 1000 songs onto this device, On-The-Go playlists cease to function.

This is very, very sad for a player with 8GB of memory. It's supposed to hold over 2000 songs, but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded?  Wow.  Unbelievable.

This is a well-documented bug on the Apple discussion forums, yet Apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet.  Will they ever?  Who cares?  Why should they, if consumers like you keep buying it and RAVING about it?

I bought my 8GB Nano, but returned it two days later when I found out the problem was known, but not fixed and not fixable.

Apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them!  Don't they test these things?!?!?!

By the way, the same problem also occurs on the 4GB Nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it, which isn't all that hard to do...

If you don't care about having more than 1000 songs, or you don't care about On-The-Go playlists actually working as advertised, what are you doing shopping for an 8GB player?  Better stick with your 2GB models..
