The absolutely worst headphones I have ever had.  Trying the different sizes, the earplugs just don't want to stay in my ears (even standing still).  The headphones that come with the I-Pod, and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better.  The sound was fine, but not any better than the standard headphones.  A poor product.  I was very disappointed, as I have had good experiences in general with Apple in the past
