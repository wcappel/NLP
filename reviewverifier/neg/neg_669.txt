I've had many fax machines and this one, when it worked, certainly wasn't the worst of the bunch. Problem is, the auto document feed tray is cheesy. No matter how many times I smoothed, then fanned the paper, it would accept two to five sheets at a time. If I fed one at a time, this unit worked like a champ. Unfortunately, that can be said of most units.  I've had good Brother machines in the past, and probably will buy another, better, Brother fax. This one got me so frustrated I threw it out the back door. It's still laying there, only there seems to be more pieces now
