when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between $1000 and 1499.99.
new contract claims that my purchase had to be under $1000 so they will NOT honor it. this means i do not have an extended warranty.
i either want this warranty for the price that was agreed upon or a full refund.
i'm happy i found out about this problem before i needed the warranty.
