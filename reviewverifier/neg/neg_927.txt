Do not buy.  This may be the worst product I've ever bought.  It has never worked properly.  I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good.  Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens.  Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end.  It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen.

Awful product.  Believe the bad reviews.  It's worse than they describe.

The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy.  My cat loves the laser pointer
