After two weeks of use, I returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times I tried to make a right click, it would not work. I eventually got frustrated and decided to return it.
I'm sure it has to do with the way I use the mouse but I'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail. I think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect.
I wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect.
I LOVED the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly
