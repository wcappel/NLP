Please, do not buy or use this product. The "hand-stitched, supple leather" scratched my new 60G black iPod video. The description says it "will fit all iPod videos" but mine was very tight. So far, DLO has not answered my complaints. Neither has Apple. I bought the Speck ToughSkin (have not received it yet) and hope it helps me heal the pain. Bad product
