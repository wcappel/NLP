If you have a 30 gig. video iPod, mabey.  But for a 60 gig. it is too tight to it, got a mark on iPod after taking it out, covered up part of the screen on mine, and I'm taking it back right away.

It is a waste of money to buy this product and I made a mistake by getting it for myself.  Get a different case than this one
