I was hoping that by getting this I'd get a decent flow of air and i'd be able to use it anywayer. But I was sorely dissappointed. It doesn't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel... plus its too loud to use in most places...

If you really need it, you can get it... but I can't use mine often because like I said its too loud. Not worth it, not enough air flowing
