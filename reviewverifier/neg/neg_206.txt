This mouse was barely functional.  It did move the arrow across the screen, but it was in a very random fashion.  I went to the Macally website and downloaded the latest drivers.  Still no luck.  I'm sending this back.  Guess I'll have to stick with my reliable Kensington. Too bad it's so ugly and doesn't match my ice keyboard.  Oh well... function over form
