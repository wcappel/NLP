I tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and I could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs, but most of the time it failed. I tried to record with an ipod - no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives. 

I'm very glad that amazon took this unit back.

I would not recommend this unit.
