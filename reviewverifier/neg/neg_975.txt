Got it and plugged it into my IPod and there was a major incompatibility.  The screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the IPod but when I went to record I received an error message that the IPod could not locate a microphone.  Perhaps an IPod problem?  The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated.  I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis.  Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod????
