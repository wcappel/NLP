Amazon says that it is in stock.
Do not believe it.
I ordered  it at 8/26 and they could not even ship it at 10/1.
They delayed it several times saying that it is in stock.
Of course the website says that it is always "IN STOCK"
and can ship it now.
Maybe their now is like 3 months...
My current keyboard has broken keys, and I have serious inconvenience because of this
