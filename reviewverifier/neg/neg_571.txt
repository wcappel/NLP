I spoke with customer service rep at 800-283-1311.  Devices have a one-year warranty.  I stated that I sent in the Registration card, and asked if she would look up the purchase date.  She said no, "Registration and Warrany are in different departments."

She asked me to hold, and came back on the line stating that since this model originally sold in 2003, my unit went off warranty in 2004 unless I have the invoice.  I called back about an hour later, after finding the invoice, and got the same customer service rep.  She recognized me and belittled me for calling back and said unless I have a question, there's nothing they can do.  I stated that I found the invoice as requested and she asked me to fax it to her.  I did that, so far no response.  We'll see if they replace the unit or not.

Just an FYI...after the one-year warranty, there are no options. The do not offer parts or service after the one-year warranty
