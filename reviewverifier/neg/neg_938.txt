I've spent over two hours tweaking this, and over an hour on the phone with customer support.  The thing still wont connect to the internet.  Don't get me wrong, the lights light up and my laptop can connect to the ROUTER, but the router wont connect to the internet.
Belkin tech support told me to send it back.  I will and I think I will try the Dlink Pre N.
