I've found these headphones to be highly overrated.  

The noise cancelling is primarily from the snug fit in the ear.  When the noise circuit is turned on, the background "hiss" becomes incredibly annoying.  To be fair though, this model does remove some background low frequency sound, even in addition to the the noise reduction from the ear plugs.  

The frequency response during playback sounds like an old am radio
