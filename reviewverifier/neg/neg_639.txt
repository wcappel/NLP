Device unexpectedly stopped working after 9 months.  Has not been thru a washing machine, fallen in the ocean or been run over by a truck!  Just nestled in my briefcase.  Bullet-proof case is great gimick, but this device is unreliable as a backup for "road" files.  Might be better off using your PDA with a large SD card
