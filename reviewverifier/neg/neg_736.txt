my this earbud headphone is  poor in bass response comapared to my sony mdr g-54lp(beware mdr-g54lp and mdr g54lp is two different models there is difference of - sign)  actually in experts view this type small earbuds use to give poor sound this is true with any  brand and model so never buy earbud type small headphone if you want small headphone buy IN THE EAR CANAL  type headphone  in experts view this type in ear earphone use to give good crystal clear sound example sony mdr ex 71 / 81, shure e2c etc. if bigger headphone is ok than buy mdr-g54lp
