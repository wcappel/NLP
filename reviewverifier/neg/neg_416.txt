It is an okay printer (I haven't done photos yet) and pretty fast but I have to change the cartridges every 3-4 weeks. This is just home use I'm talking about, not business use.
The cartridges are small, run out real fast and cost up to $60 a month for one black and one color.
I'm thinking of going back to a Lexmark
