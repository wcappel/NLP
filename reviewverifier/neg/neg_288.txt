I returned this thing the day after I bought it.  

I should of been clued in when I purchased it at the store, ALL the Transpod models had a little sticker on them advising them about the store's return policy.  I thought it a little unusual at the time, but after listening to the thing I understand why now.  I'm sure a lot of people had been returning this model.

The sound quality was really bad.  You have to turn your stereo WAY up to hear the music, and even then it sounds almost as bad as AM radio.  I'll add that the files I was playing were 192Kbps aac encoded files so they're decent quality too
