I will not be sending this item to my frail 85-year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of Florida.  It is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio.  Most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment.  This is unacceptable design failure for something the Red Cross is touting as a household essential.

When the company was contacted for assistance, they suggested inserting a butter knife in the hinge and forcing the cover open!!  Folks have already reported being injured in trying to force the cover open.

I will be returning this one as soon as I can
