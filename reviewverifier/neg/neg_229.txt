I have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now.  While the program is well thought out and provides a good function, it does not work well with my Tungsten T5.  I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below), but to no avail.  

Some of the issues I have had:

Any time the software has to redirect or think, it locks up.  If I stay on the original planned route, it sometimes works properly...

In a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach, I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up.

Voices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device.

In a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times.  I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me.

Bear in mind, I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software.  Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing.  

In summary, it's not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest
