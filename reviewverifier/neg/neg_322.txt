I have a D-link router, and I couldn't even get this thing to connect wirelessly.  It works if connected with a ethernet wire, but that isn't really the point, is it?

I called customer support, and the call dropped 4 TIMES!!!!  Even when I was able to stay connected, they obviously weren't listening to me, and were of no use in the end.  I'm off to go return.  Save your time, money, and aggrevation.  Avoid this like the plague
