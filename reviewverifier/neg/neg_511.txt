I started out with 2 gigabytes. And then after I had filled this card with about 500 photos, I downloaded all the photos to my computer. After deleting all of the photos from this card, the capacity had suddenly decreased to only half! What happened to the other 1 gigabyte? I'm sure they pre-formatted this card to appear like it's 2 gigabytes, but what a surprise when you start using it. Not good
