I have used these labels for a long time, mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there. The paperstock is good, but if you have a good printer the paper won't do it justice. The labels always end up looking kinda cheap.  I would love to see Memorex make a package with glossy  paper/high end paper. Maybe Epson will beat them to it
