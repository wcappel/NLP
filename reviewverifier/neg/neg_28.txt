I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase.  However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check.  I was astonished.  I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.  With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item.  If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.  But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice.
