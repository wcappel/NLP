1. There was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when I tried multiple jacks for the base. 
2. Phone features worked as advertised. but the Voice Enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse.
3. It was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset.

I returned it mainly because of the buzzing
