Samsung is the WORST.  We bought this TV in August and it was delivered in September to our new house.  We opened it on a Sunday, plugged it in and watched it for a while, then on Monday it would not come on.  They thought it was a lamp, but that didn't fix it so they came and got it to service it.  We bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no TV.  They decided to replace it since they couldn't fix it.  That was three weeks ago.  Now they are giving us the runaround blaming shipping/warehouse/etc for the delay in sending the new one.  During a phone conversation with Samsung they basically said they were so far behind on shipping because they had so many to ship out (ie lots of them have problems and are being replaced is the way I took it.
