I bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews I read here.  I should have read further, because about two weeks after I purchased the earphones, the left side went out completely.  There was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and I didn't hear any "rattling" as described by other users.  The darn things just quit!  I must say, however, that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent, but all in all, not worth the money and frustration
