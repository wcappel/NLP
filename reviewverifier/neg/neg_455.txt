This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.
