After two months, this phone stopped working. It was returned to Panasonic Repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6-8 weeks.  This is not customer service. Panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone. When called today to check on status of order, answer was basically "tough luck." Never again, Panasonic. Amazon should discontinue this brand
