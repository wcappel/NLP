Do not be fooled when the description says this stand holds up to 21&quot; monitors - that is only true for *flat-panel* monitors, not traditional CRT monitors.  Note that the weight rating says 50 pounds!  Most standard 19&quot; monitors weigh 60 pounds or more.  I purchased this item at a Staples near me, and brought it home to use with my 19&quot; CRT.  After placing the monitor on the stand, the stand bobbed up and down and seemed as if it would completely bend at any moment
