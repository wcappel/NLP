I didn't have the same experience as the "Great support from Lexar" review below.

The rubber caps on the Sport Jumpdrives will quickly split open and you will probably loose your jumpdrive when it fall off your keychain.

Unlike the person below, Lexar would not send me a free replacement.  They said that I could go to their web site an purchase another rubber cap.

Poor support for a poor product
