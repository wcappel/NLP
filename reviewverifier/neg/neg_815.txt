The charger is very convenient.  Power related to AD/DC is extremely useful.  High-tech design and features.  Sucking and blowing power does not measure up to the price.  It has an extremely disappointing performance.  It feels like a child toy rather than a useful tool for a personal computer or laptop.  Will not recommend anyone to purchase this item due to the lack of performance
