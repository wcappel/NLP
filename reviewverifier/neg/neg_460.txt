Short answer: The microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume, and cannot be adjusted independently--either through the device or at the O/S level.

I spoke with tech support, and they said this was to keep the echo-cancellation software from having issues.

So as a speakerphone, this device is useless.

I'd have given it one star, but the rest of the device is actually very well designed, easy to setup, and so on.
