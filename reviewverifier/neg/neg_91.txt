I purchased this and am not impressed.  Note that "works with all click wheel iPods" isn't true.  It does NOT work with photo iPods (at least the 60 GB model). I'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit.  I'm ordering a 'photo dock' since I can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60GB/photo model.

If I'd known this, I'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately, since I already have a charger (came with it...).  Grr.  :-
