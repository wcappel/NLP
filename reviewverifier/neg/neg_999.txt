I have bought several of these. Some came in a fancy blister, and others in a coushing bag. Stay away from those. Be sure you're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different.

I give the generic two stars just because it works. I give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it's a little difficult to remove the card
