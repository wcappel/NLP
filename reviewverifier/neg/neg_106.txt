Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. 
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo
