This phone is a total piece of garbage. Freezing, rebooting, not being 
able to connect to hot spots, not logging you out of skype if you are 
logged on at your computer at the same time. Horrible tech support. Can 
I add any more negative feedback? Oh yeah the rediculous ring tones and 
speaker quality. Thanks for nothing netgear and for making me wait 6 
months on pre order for a real piece of plastic junk
