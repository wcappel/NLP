 Do not be deceived by the photo this thing is tiny. If that is what you are looking very small low volume very portable I suppose it is ok but over price for what you get. I think $30.00 would have been about right. There is no bass response and for there size how could there be. I am keeping them but only because they are so small they might come in handy for hotel use only! The packaging is very cool but the fidelity is non existent
