To anyone who may like these, I am sorry to learn about your hearing disability. The T33 looked like a nice little package, but I thought, "How could it possibly sound even acceptable?" I hoped for a Sony surprise, but it didn't happen. When I returned them later that day, the clerk asked, 
"Is there anything wrong with them?" I said, "Yeah, they suck". 
She smiled and handed me a refund.
