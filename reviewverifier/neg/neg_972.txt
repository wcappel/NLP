The phone worked for a month or two, and then the handset stopped seeing the base. When I followed the instructions in the manual to fix this (re-register the handset to the base), neither could see each other.
The base still gets the land-line signal and works with speakerphone, but that is useless to me since I need the handset.

When I contacted Uniden through their email support, I got no response.

I will be buying another phone that is not a Uniden
