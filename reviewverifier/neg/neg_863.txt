This router had 1/4th the range of my standard linksys G-router which suddenly burned out after less then a year.  The speed (when I could get a signal) was 1 to 11 Mbps, my old router held a steady 54Mbps.  I did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house, but I couldn't use it with this router.  The expander only works with the basic G-router, so no way to even boost the signal on this new one.  Support was a joke, couldn't get any help or explaination as to why the "Expanded Range" was so much less range the the previous "unexpanded range"  Bought another older version, and everything's great again.  Don't waste your money or time on this
