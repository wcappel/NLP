While certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the CDs and the general labels, I found this product much less than satisfactory.  

The inserts and the software don't align too well and are a few centimeters off...especially on the lower half of the page.  If one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the "cut offs" are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed.

Otherwise, I would suggest what another Amazon customer has done. Use cardstock paper....at least for the back inserts.  And trim with either a scissors or paper cutter.

A product should do what it promises it will do.  Unfortunately, this one does not.  At least, within my experiance this does not measure up to what was previewed within the Memorex beginner's package w/ CD label stamper.  

Two stars for at least being able to print the front side.  Although it would have been nice if they had said so without stating they could do both when they cannot
