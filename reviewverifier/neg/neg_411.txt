For over eight years (nearly 9), I had an Acer 17" CRT & loved it. I use a KVM to switch computers, & the CRT kept all of my adjustments for that computer, every time.
When it started showing signs of age (about four months ago), I decided to try a flat screen, or LCD, though I've heard horror stories about them, my laptop is great.

I don't mind the dark overlay associated w/LCDs, I have that on my laptop. I was amazed at how poorly this monitor responds to things. I still swap computers. I can't get the same clarity that I once did.

I swap between ME & XP, which shouldn't matter.

Don't believe there isn't any flicker, that's wrong. If you change the refresh rate, the monitor changes, not the computer. What happened to dumb monitors (what happened to dumb printers)? Best, should be a button (turn on) away. Some tweaking isn't bad.

Fade out: I have the monitor, at the "proper" height, & the upper & lower corners fade. As looking at any lcd from an angle.
You can't tilt this monitor very much at all

Don't spend much time on shut down or re-start in ME, the lines & jaggies will kill you.

I'm sorry that I bought this monitor. The refesh rate for games, is fair. Don't play any games prior to ME! Because ME era games fade badly at the ends, nearly blacking out. Post XP isn't anything to write home about really.

I would suggest trying out an hdtv first. With a direct (vga) plug in. It's a few dollars more, but if you're considering an hdtv, as well as a monitor, I'd chance it. You can always buy a 20" CRT for less.

I hope this helps
