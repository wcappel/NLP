Adorama is a terrible company to deal with. They sent me a pkg of 2 Epson ink cartridges and 270 papers.  I have called several times as the ink cartridges were not the correct ones. I returned them as instructed, written 3 letters and called. This started in mid July.  I called 2 weeks ago (Aug 28th and a different gal said she thought I should have my money back and would see to it.  That was over 2 weeks ago and nothing since then.  
I would recommend that anyone should NOT order from this company
