I wanted to connect a computer to a router, and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router.  So I figured I needed a long cord, and decided to get this one, which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch (which was what I needed.)  Well, it's long.  That's the only good thing about this cord.  But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless.  There is nothing on the ends!  It's just a giant wire!  There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router.  So I have a cord, but no connectors.  It's completely useless, unless I buy the connectors separately, and attach them myself.  Do I know how to do that?  Do I want to do that?  No.   So I'm returning this.  Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this.  Otherwise, it's completely useless.  If you can't find any cords this long that have connectors, maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord.  ..
