I bought a second Traveldrive because the first one purchased worked just fine.  The second drive does not work on my system (Windows Millenium).  Calling the service line I found out that there are two versions and the second is not compatible with the first.  After trying all the recommended solutions, the tech support suggested I request a warranty replacement/trade for the original version or simply get my money back.  Requests for a resolution of the matter have fallen on deaf ears.  I would not waste any more money on products from this company
