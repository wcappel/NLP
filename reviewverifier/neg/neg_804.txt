I bought this so I could listen to my iPod in my car in the city.  The first couple of times, it worked great, but after that, something happened.  It just wouldn't work.  All I heard was static, no matter what frequency I tried this on.  I have yet to take a road trip with it, so maybe that will work better, but right now, I am not happy with the product.  Maybe the fact that I live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it, but it used to work on some frequencies, and now it just doesn't anymore.  I am very disappointed
