The headset sits on the back of head, which is ok, however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable. I was not able to use volume control, as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level.

The mic is poor.  Whether you want it for gaming or just general purpose use, its better to skip this for something else
