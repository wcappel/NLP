One star is too many!  (It should be negative one).  This sad excuse for a television/radio has to be the worst piece of lame crud I have ever bought in my entire life.  Picture fades into black, terrible reception which fades in and out as you move about the room, smells like burning plastic after a half-hour, and so on.  Please, Amazon shoppers, don't waste any money on this!  You might just as well throw the $15 out the window.  Step up to something more reliable from a better manufacturer
