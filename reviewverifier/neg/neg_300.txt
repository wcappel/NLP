I had this GPS device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre.

Although at one point I was able to track 6 WAAS satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet, while driving along a straight road for 5.5 miles, it indicated that I was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road.  On two occasions on this straight road, it said I actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side.

I conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless.  The trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a quarter-mile during that hour.  I checked the accuracy at 15-minute intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between 12-24 feet.

The base maps are crude and inaccurate - a major 4-lane road (Hwy 7) in Tacoma, WA stops at 38th street.  Really?!?  If I drive down Hwy 7, it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows.

While using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings - understandable.  There is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little - nice.  I tried and tried to find "level" according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where "level" was.  It was nowhere close to actual level.  Now, if I am trying to navigate with the unit's compass while it is mounted to my bike, there is no way it is going to be level and accurate.

At 5.3 ounces, it doesn't even pass off as a good paperweight.

Fortunately I was able to return it to the seller with no problems for a full refund (Thank you REI!).  I found out that Wal-Mart.com sells the unit for 50 bucks less than REI after I bought it though.

Recommendation:  If you need a paperweight, get a rock - if you need a GPS, get a different one.
