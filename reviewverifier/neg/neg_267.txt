These speakers are o.k., but don't expect high sound quality (I bought these as refurbs, so maybe that is it, but when you turn up the volume, they don't sound good - I'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new).  Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room.  This should not be a problem on this low bandwidth (but it is), perhaps the antenna needs a boost
