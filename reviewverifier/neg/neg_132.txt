This has to be the worst keyboard I've purchased.  It's my first wireless.  I've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this.

With the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high.  Without it there is a 'hump' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle.

The plastic is really bad.  It feels really cheap and slick.  

Before I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond.  

So, bad product....company on the slide.....doesn't add up to a good value.  

Logitech used to be the best company out there...or at least one of the best...
