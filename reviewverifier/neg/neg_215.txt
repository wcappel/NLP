I guess for $50, this is an ok product.  I am usually very against monster products, but I'd seen this for almost double at big box retailers, needed a surge protector for my new DLP tv, so figured what the heck.  It arrived without incident, I hooked it up and so far so good.  It basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple... for the "neato" effect I guess.  Anyways, no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector.  But the claims of independent circuitry to minimize cross-interference is what I was really interested in, as I have my reciever, cable box, DVD player, and subwoofer all connected...  All in all a good buy I guess, at least you paid a lot less than retail... :
