Powder from the toner cartridges get all over the inside of the printer and then ruins every page that is printed.  Every page that is printed from my printer has a greyish color due to the powder dirt inside.  It is impossible to clean it since the powder is everywhere.  The only way to get it clean would be to bring it to a car wash (obviously this would leave the printer with bigger problems than page color).  What a waste of money!!!  Good thing my office bought it and not me or I would be furious
