We bought three Creative players.  My husband and I have the Zen micro and my daughter the Zen 20GB.  All three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year.  I didn't even use mine but maybe two hours per week.  Good thing my daughter's was within her one year period by a couple of days. She still had to pay $25.00  Now my husband and I have to just junk ours and buy something else.  Customer service is awful!!  They won't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times.  What a piece of garbage!!
