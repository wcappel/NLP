This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.

1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.

2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant

3. It is clunky

4. Does not comke with a power adapte
