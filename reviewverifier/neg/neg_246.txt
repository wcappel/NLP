I purchased my Fuji CompactFlash xD Card Adapter elsewhere and it doesn't work in my HP officejet 7130 all-in-one.  It won't load in as it's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards.  Except then I get an amber light that says there is a card error.  This is supposed to work with my all-in-one but it doesn't.  For that reason, I'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed.  I'm going to take this CP version back and hope the more updated CPF version works.  I'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles, but I'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly.  This one is definitely a thumbs down.  However, this is my first dud Fuji product I've bought and I love Fuji digital cameras
