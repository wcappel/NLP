I ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it.  I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.   
I got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got.  (Apple doesn't offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range)
