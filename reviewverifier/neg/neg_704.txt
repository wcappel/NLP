As others have reported, my latch broke as well, but I broke it within three days of ownership.  Within a month, I cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when I was removing it from the case to sync it.  At the time, the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable.  Bought a Rhinoskin to replace this.  Look elsewhere before you purchase this one
