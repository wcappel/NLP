A $150 calculator that I am going to trash.  I had the same problem with the keyboard (terrible response); I struggled with it for about a year and then called HP.  My warranty was out, so Hp suggested I install an update, which I did.  Now the keys are firing off 3 or 4 digits with one press of the button.  This is ridiculous.
