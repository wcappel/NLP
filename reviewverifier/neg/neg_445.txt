The description indicates that it works on Mac platform. 
But it does not. And the funny thing is the instruction.
It says "if it does not work, try different computer." 
Very helpful, isn't it?
So I had to use my PC and set up a network w/ Mac and trasnfer. 
Too much trouble if you have a Mac.
However, it's easy to use. Hook up and click, click. that's it.
