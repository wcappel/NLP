These discs are not really TDK - they are low-quality discs branded and priced as TDK.  
I have a Samsung S182M DVD Burner and it will not recognize these discs at all.  It just spins them around and around forever.  The one time I got it to recognize one of these, it reported that it was Media ID Daxon0016s.  Avoid these.
