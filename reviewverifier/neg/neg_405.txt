I have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built-in navigation system in my Lexus.  

Software installation is fairly easy.  However, you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states; I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  

While the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing, the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy, but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose, this is NOT the right product.  

The pros are:
 - Inexpensive in comparison to built-ins und stand-alone products
 - Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking
 - One device serves multiple purposes

The cons are:
 - It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car's OEM navigation system.
 - The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system:  I live in Phoenix, AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don't exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website).
 - Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards, when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the built-in navigation.
 - Look-up function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn't display actual address until you map it.
 - It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day, requiring a soft reset.  
 - Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.

Overall, the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination, you are better off with a stand-alone unit.  I truly wish I had better things to say about this device since I really like the concept, but the reality just doesn't match the marketing.
