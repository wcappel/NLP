I have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that I did.

Or else they wrote their review too soon.

I bought mine in June 2006.  It failed before the store warranty ran out.  One down.  The replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and wouldn't boot.  Two down.  Sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free RMA.  That one also failed.  Three down.  They replaced it with both a m230 AND a 2GB c150.  The c150 hung after about 2 weeks.  Four down.  I have been using the m230 for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the c150 replacement arrives.  I have gotten quite good at the RMA game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or I get one of those that other people rave about.

I don't think I'll buy another SanDisk - unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty.

I suggest that everyone with a failed m230 to exercise thier warranty rights.  Sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products.
