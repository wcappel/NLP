I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrong
Itunes and Ipods are definitely much better..
Basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like Sandisk's approach is WYSIWYG..disappointing

PROS:
- long battery life
- email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks bad

CONS:
- it's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless
- buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on
- wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality
- software is buggy and terrible
- freezes occasionally
- navigating through menus stutters and lags
- boot time is 10 seconds
- video mode has no options
- needs serious firmware updates
- time is listed only in settings menu = useless
- tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly
- every firmware update erases all your settings, including radio presets
and the list of issues goes on and on...

anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritating
I am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever again

My suggestion is to try it out thorougly before buying..so you dont make the same mistake I did and trust other people's lopsided reviews..
