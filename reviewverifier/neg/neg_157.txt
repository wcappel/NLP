callers can barely hear me, even with the mic right in my mouth (volume adjustment on cord doesnt affect it).
and even worse, callers hear an echo of themselves, the mic picks up the caller in the earpiece enough to resend it!  (echo!). Must be because its all on the same arm or something crappy.  This makes it basically unusable, so waste of money, throw away, going to buy a better one
