I waited 10 days for this to arrive. The first time I plugged it in it ran for 2 minutes.  I typed Dear and the machine typed wcm"  When I tried  to erase wcm" the erase mechanism did not work. I turned the machine off and when I switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move, ie I cannot type or use the machine in any way. When the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and I had to stick them back on. Now when I look at the machine I can see it is assymetrical...there is a 1/4 gap in the base, so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere.  This is not acceptable but I have no way to contact whoever Mstasad is.  I have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but I don't have a typewriter that works.  I feel cheated and am very upset..
