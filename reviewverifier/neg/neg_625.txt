The first Vista Cx I purchased died after only 3 days of use. I returned it to Amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it.  The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket. Though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen. Garmin's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney. The poorly designed T-style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity. I probably wouldn't buy buy another Garmin but I'm stuck with them as I have already invested $200 in proprietary MapSource software.  I guess that was their plan.
On the plus side, the Vista Cx did seem to function as it should...for all of 7 days
