It's the most expensive CF card with absolutely no customer support.  After a while the CF card stopped working - no power light as if the card &quot;burned out&quot;.  I really can't tell you exactly what went wrong because it's impossible to contact someone at Socket customer support. I followed their web-site instructions but was never contacted. I'll never buy another Socket product again
