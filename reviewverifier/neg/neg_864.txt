Despite the slick marketing effort (i.e. "With SRX"), this product falls short.

The installation disk is useless.
Customer support was good, when I could get through - which was not very often.
I constantly lost the wireless connection.
I constantly had to re-boot.
Despite significant effort (utilizing the online help features) I could never obtain a secure, encrypted connection.

No more Linksys for me!
