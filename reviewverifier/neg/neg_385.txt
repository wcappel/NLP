I like the light that goes on when the phone rings but that is about all I like about this phone.  Friends tell me I sound like I am under water and I have had to terminate many conversations due to static and interference.  One friend insists that I have a microwave running as we speak.  I am actively looking for a new set to buy because these are worthless
