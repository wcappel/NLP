I bought this print server back in December 2005. I used it with my All-in-One Brother printer MFC-4800. The installation was easy. It worked great......for 4 months. Then...then... it just stoped working after 4 months. I tried to disconnect and reconnect the power, Ethernet cable etc...nothing helped. 
May be I just got a bad product
