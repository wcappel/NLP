I bought this a few weeks ago so that I could connect a cordless phone to my office computer and use Skype for my calling.  When it works, it works well, and the sound quality is fine.  Unfortunately, much of the time, it doesn't work.  It drops calls at random.  Customer support is dismal, I emailed them several days ago and didn't even get a response acknowledging the email, let alone a solution to my problem.  Just now I have tried reinstalling the drivers but that seems to be failing.  

We have a VoSky Call Center at home that so far has been working much better.  I bought the the DPH-50U because I was in a hurry and the store I was at only carried it, not the VoSky.  I wish I had waited and bought a second VoSky
