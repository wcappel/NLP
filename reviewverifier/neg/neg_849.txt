This flash drive does not work with Windows 98SE. The back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for Windows 98SE at the maufacturer's web site. First I tried downloading the driver. Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver. After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC. The FAQ at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled. But the FAQ doesn't tell you how to enable the BIOS
