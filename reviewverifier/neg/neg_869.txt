These earphones provide excellent sound for the money. Rich bass, sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces. 

However I experienced painful electric shocks in both ears if I put pressure on my eardrums, such as getting up from a chair. And that was before I stood in the puddle of water. Just kididng. Shocks occured in first and Sony-provided replacement pair. They eventually replaced with an on-the-ear model. 

I have no problems with other Sony headphones or earphones, I think the speaker membrane was positioned too close to my eardrums. Since there are on other comments about this issue, I'll assume its isolated, but beware of shocks on perhaps a smaller scale.
