Finally.  

Next time I can't find my keys in the dark all I need to do is find this thingie and fumble it into my iPod's holes.  What a lifesaver!

And in the same box is the laser pointer so I don't have to stop listening to 50cent just because I'm doing some silly corporate presentation!  

While it is a little tough to dance and fry an airline pilot's eyes at the same time, it is the latest craze so I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
