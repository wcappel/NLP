Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to  change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute
