Like the forward/back buttons but they are located too far back on the body for comfort.  Like the scroll wheel and side-to-side scroll ability.  Pointer flickers a lot sometimes and often disappears over certain buttons.  Logitech website gives no help.
Comes with an installation CD for a Logitech MX320 !!!  Be prepared for a 50MB download to install the MX400.  Almost makes Microsot look good
