I'm mad.  I bought this one to replace my old one.  This one and the other one are doing the samething.  I had a chat with an HP service helper and they determined that it was broke.  Their customer service is top notch thought!  They are sending me a new one for free and apearently I get to keep the ink cartidges for free because of my troubles
