Avoid this product at all costs!!!  I should've listened to the other reviews but NOOOO, I just had to see it for myself.  This product worked (barely) for 2 weeks then just totally died.  In the short time that it worked, the sound quality was just horrible.  No matter what free channel you play it on.  I have a good 40 mile drive one way (not city or metropolitan driving) and in that span, I'll have to switch channels between 3 to 5 times. 
Kudos to Amazon's hassle free return policy, I was able to return it and get the Belkin TuneBase FM which I highly recommend
