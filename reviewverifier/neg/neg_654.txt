A short list of grievances:

1. The earbuds don't fit well in the ear
2. The retraction wheel is in the middle of the cord, so that if you're walking while listening to music, it bounces around and threatens to pull the buds out of your ears.
3. The retraction wheel broke after a month, making these headphones no longer retractable.

NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU'LL SPEND ON SHIPPING, let alone the cost of the headphones. These headphones are garbage
