It states in the Technical Details that you can get 450 pictures from this cartridge. This is not true.  After much discussion with HP, they finally admitted that it's only rated for 150 4 x 6 pictures.  My experience is that you actually get a little under 100 pictures from it.  If you're buying this cartridge, you've probably already bought the printer, but you should know before you buy the printer that you're going to go through a lot of expensive ink
