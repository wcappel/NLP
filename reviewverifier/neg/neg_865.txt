I am a huge Logitech fan and buy their products in the truck load, unfortunately, this webcam is a dog with fleas.  The picture is blurry, the lighting is abmismal in low light and you can just get better performance from a less expensive web cam.  I am still a Logitech fan, but you can get better performance from QuickZoom
