When I first started using this, I loved it.  It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound.  In fact, I bought a second one for my wife.  Then, after about two weeks, it stopped working.  It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time.  I tried contacting Coby's support on the Web, but they were unresponsive.  Luckily, Amazon took it back for a refund.  Note that they no longer sell these directly.  Bet they had too many returns..
