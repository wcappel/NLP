My brother got a Lexar for Christmas.  He put it in his Tungsten C and for 30 stressful minutes the card did not work.  The device recognized the card, but you could not copy, format, nothing... just got an error &quot;This card is read only and cannot be &lt;whatever&gt;.&quot;  Then all of a sudden it started working.  2 stars for the stress and for the fear that it will stop working again
