No way am I purchasing this for my iPod. I would love to be able to charge my iPod away from my iMac, but I refuse to purchase this. This should of been included in the box. It is a tremendous ripoff to buy an AC adapter seprately (and at $30), but then again, I'm sure Apple is making a ton off of this gimic, but I refuse to contribute. I can see not including a dock, A/V cables, etc, as those aren't   essential iPod accessories. But an AC adapter? Come on. Bad Apple. Bad!

On the plus side, this AC adapter is smaller and comes with an iPod to charger (or iPod to computer) cable, which the previous model did not include. It's still a ripoff, though
