My company supplies these cordless headsets to its employees so I have alot of experience using headsets.  This is the latest upgrade and it is the worst unit I have ever used.  It works great for about 3 or 4 months on average.  After that, the voice unit stops working.  I can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me.  I have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted &lt; 5 months.  One broke after &lt; 2 months.  Other colleagues have complained about the same thing happening with their units.  After the experiences I have had with this piece of junk, I would never buy anything from Plantronics with my own money.  Avoid this rubbish
