and the worst part is that I'm actually glad about it!

I bought this set to replace a [...]Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo that was about 3 years old when the mouse scroll wheel stopped working.

I figured I'd treat myself to what looked like the best wireless set out there.  Here's what I found:

1) The keyboard is HUGE.  I have Dell 19" flat panel and the keyboard looks ridiculous in front of it.

2) Even though the USB dongle is plugged in the Dell monitor about 1 foot from the mouse/keyboard it still loses its connection and I get the message "USB device has malfunctioned."  I have to remove and replace the dongle and it starts again.  This happens a couple of times a week, but of course at the most inconvenient times.

3) The keyboard goes to sleep like the mouse after a few minutes to save battery life.  The mouse will wake up after a slight delay and I'm used to that but I can't tell you how many times I pressed "Ctrl-C" to copy something into the buffer and then discovered that it didn't "take" because the keyboard was asleep.  The keyboard should never go to sleep or this "feature" should have a way to be disabled!

4) The keyboard died (stopped responding) at less than 6 months old.  I still use the mouse but dug out an ancient Dell quietkey wired keyboard.  Frankly I don't miss the behemoth MS monster at all, at least the old keyboard doesn't take up the whole desk and when I hit Ctrl-C it works every time.

Microsoft has made some good keyboards and mice, but this set is not one of them.  Buyer beware.
