Low volume ... people can not hear me at the other end. I therefore have to return it. 

I liked my Siemens 8825 much much better. 
Other complaints:
1. No central office voice mail indicator
2. All handsets display the same missed call messages; so the same missed call has to be handled 4 times. A very stupid 
design. 
3. Large heavy handset
4. This is not a phone system. It is a collection of phones.
