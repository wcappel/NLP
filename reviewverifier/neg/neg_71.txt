This product is not for the heavy handed 
after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'.
on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types
