Can not get this thing to connect to my Linksys Wireless router.  Problem is not that it doesn't see the LinkSys, the problem is that the v2.50 firmware in the WLI-TX4-G54HP is _buggy_.  If I try to enter a 10-digit hex key for 64-bit WEP encryption-- it says I have to enter a 5-digit value.  This is the 2nd one I bought (I returned the first).  Piece of junk, and _no_ support from the manufacturer
