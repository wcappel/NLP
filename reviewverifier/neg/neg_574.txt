I bought this unit to use with a boombox and it functioned well but after a few minutes it just went blank. I tried batteries in the boombox, AC power and two boomboxes because they thought the boombox was the problem 

But after two boomboxes I guess the problem is the Roady.

Anyone else have this problem?

I use the XM only at home with the boombox. 

Currently waiting for response from Crutchfield and Delphi.

I will post again when (if) this is resolved.
