Everyone has already covered the basics, so here's the highlights:

The audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.

The headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don't slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.

At first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth.

After 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don't expect it to work 4 months from now.

I really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear.

In the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time, I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad
