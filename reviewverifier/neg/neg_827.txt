I just purchased the HP DVD740e from costco, and burned the CDR disc came with drive. The lightscribe worked really well, it was the first experience, so I came here for reviews on DVDR, I was told that the Verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the HP's, so I purchased the Verbatim 30pk, received today.  I was so excited, that I immediately burn two discs with the best setting, but both come out fuzzy and presented the "out of focus" dull feel, look terrible with no detail compared to the HP bonus disc. Is this a joke? This is my first Amazon review, can't help to vent my disappointment. Thanks for the super fast shipping anyway.
