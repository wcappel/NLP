I had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338.  The main reason is the speed.  I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318's at 1.2Mbps!  This is unacceptable.  Oh yes, this is with the latest firmware.

Several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem.  I contacted their legal deptartment the same day.  Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS!

I have successfully sued to get my money back.

With all of my venting done, I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it.  But Netgear be warned, I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported
