I recently received an iPOD Photo and after loading in tons of CD's I said  . . . hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car.  My transpod arrived but I had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car's charger.  After working that out and using it everyday for a week, it stopped working.  I realized that the fuse had blown.  It's small and relatively compact unlike the Griffin RoadTrip, but it's a whole lot of drama for the price.  

With regard to the quality of the sound through my vehicle's audio system, I am extremely disappointed.  What sounds like a million dollars through headphones does not translate to what you hear through fm radio frequencies.  I have adjusted the iPOD's equalizer and played around with some options inside my car, but I am extremely disappointed.  If someone has a better alternative . . . GOD BLESS YOU but don't waste your money on this product
