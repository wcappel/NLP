I bought this printer about 4 months ago.  The prints are beautiful, and the speed quite good as well.  However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of "X" color installed.  It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document.  There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it.  Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item
