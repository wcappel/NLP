I've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them.  I still love them now....  when they work.  The problem is that the cord is shoddy.  When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working.  I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work.  If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all.  I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.  I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.  Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit
