I have the same issue as "Misleading Item Description" below.  The only reason I bought this is because I thought it was the complete set.  What good is a headset without the base?  

WARNING! TigerDirect does not except returns on this headset; so now I must return the headset to TigerDirect, then buy the full unit from TigerDirect or I lose my $70. The headset with the base is about $35 more expensive than what I would have payed at BUY.COM.

I expect a lot more from Amazon.  Very, Very Disappointed
