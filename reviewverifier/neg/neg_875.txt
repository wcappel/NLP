I assumed all tape adapters were comparable.  This one worked fine for 1 week.  Then it sporadically ejected itself from the tap deck.  A few days later it broke completely and is now jammed in my tape deck.  The tape deck on my car stereo is now broken as is the Macally Podtape.  I would buy another a different brand of adapter, but I no longer have a tape deck that works in my car.  My worst purchase on Amazon to date.
