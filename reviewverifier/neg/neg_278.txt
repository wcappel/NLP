I like the color and sony's technology of the earphone itself.
But the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless.
When I put the earphone in the ears, the hanger part is just hanging in the air, not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady.
Because of that, the earphones easily pop out of your ear
