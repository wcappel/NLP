Maybe 2 1/2 stars. 
Software and wireless setup for this card went fine, even great, and have continued to work for over 1 1/2 years now but . . .
Here's the rub.
Seems the housing on the card that receives the threads of the antenna was not properly attached to the board.
The antenna would not work properly - 0-50% signal strength from the Access Point in the next room when it wasn't falling off the back of my machine! Futzed with the thing getting half-*** performance with it for toooo long until . . .
Had to remove board from computer, use plier to remove antenna from the recept and VERRY carefully place the card in a vice and use vice-grip/clamp tool to forcefully slide the 1/2" housing in place onto the board.
Did this once and it didn't seat far enough (antenna fell off) and a couple weeks later had to repeat the process.
Apparently it needed to be pressed on even further and it actually snapped (securely ?) the 2nd time after using more force that you might imagine on such a delicate device.
It has worked as advertised since then (about a year now).
There ARE other reviewers who have suffered from "antenna drops off" too. Be warned.
When one pays extra "for quality" they should expect better than this.
It's time again to add to my network and will try a different board (for half the price).
