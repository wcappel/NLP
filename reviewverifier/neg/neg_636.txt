I AM DISGUSTED TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH CRUCIAL MARKETS THIS CARD AS COMING WITH A DRIVER FOR WIN98SE, IT DOES NOT.  THE CD IT CAME WITH DID NOT HAVE A DRIVER (although it said it did) THE WEB SIGHT DOES NOT HAVE DRIVERS AND AFTER TWO PROMISES ON THE PHONE FROM CRUCIAL TECH SUPPORT PROMISING TO SEND ME ONE, I STILL DON'T HAVE IT.  I DON'T BELIEVE THIS DRIVER EXISTS. SO MUCH FOR TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AND AMERICAN COMPANY INTEGRITY
