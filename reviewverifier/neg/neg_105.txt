BAD DISC ERROR - possible fix

After about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working.

I kept getting bad disc error on a new DVD I bought. I tried good discs that worked before but now got the same Bad Disc error.

This is not the first time I had problems loading. Previously, unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem.

This time after two weeks of Bad Disc errors, I was about to toss it when I decided what the heck, I'll check inside to see if it's dirty or something.

FIRST I UNPLUGGED THE UNIT.

I removed the 6 screws holding the cover. You may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off.

With my expertise knowledge. *eyeroll* I nudged the lense mechanism. It apparently slides to read the discs.

I plugged the DVD in and loaded a disc again to see what happens. The lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc. I'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day! lol

So hopefully this will last a little longer. But at least I can use it again for now ...

I am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error. The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers
