I am totally stunned that this could be sold as iPOD compatible.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, works as you would intuitively think it would.  Pause does not pause, forward arrow does not forward to the next track (just starts the same track over and over again), and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist.  There is no way to actually speed through a menu - you have to advance one artist at a time.  This is fine if you love Aaron Neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to ZZ Top.  I am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my iPod again from my iPod
