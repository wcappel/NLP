I think this product design concept is great.  I love the flexibe arm size.  It fits great in my car.  The CRAPPY part.  I live near metro st. louis and i could not hold a signal ANYWHERE!  I always had some intereference.  whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out.  This product did not meet my expectations, especially since the back of the package states I should have crystal clear sound.  This is not true.  I have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase.  I am now waiting to get my DLO transpod 2 in the mail to try it out.  I want something to work!
