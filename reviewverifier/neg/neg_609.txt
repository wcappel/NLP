I bought Magellan RoadMate 700 Vehicle GPS 2 months back and its not working as expected. its very poor in locating the the place and sometimes don't even work. Many times this sytem got hung and power off and on again is the solution to get it work again.

Might this product is very good in market, but I got the bad piece
