I had a D-link USB adaptor before which was really good, but was old.  I upgraded to a wireless G Linksys USB adaptor, but I was supplied with old goods (a Linksys sales manager confirmed that), so I sent that back.  I thought I'd try D-Link again.  Bad move.  First, I tried to upgrade the drivers.  My current version was 1.0.5.0.  I downloaded the version 1.12 from D-Link's site.  After uninstalling and reinstalling (several times) I still had 1.0.5.0.  An hour and a half on the phone with D-Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0.  Another hour on Google, and I'm not the only one with this issue.  Seems to be a version-control issue with D-Link.  Then, even more irritating, every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot.  And re-enter all my security info again.  (I believe this has something to do with using a different USB port from the last time, but whatever the reason, it's unacceptable).  This adaptor's going back too.  Don't know what I'll try next.
