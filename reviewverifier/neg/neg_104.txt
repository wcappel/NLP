It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances.
