I was extremely excited when I received this product and have had good success with Samsung products.  However, when I made all the connections, the unit didn't work.  I was disapointed and frustrated.  All the connections and settings were correct, but it didn't work.  I have an older DVI connection instead of the newer HDMI digital connection.

I returned the product and bought the Humax brand HDTV tuner.  I bought a DVI to HDMI cable and connected the unit.  It works like a charm!  I don't know what was wrong with the Samsung SIR-T451, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  I'm also having second thoughts about Samsung products now.  It seems like the reliability/quality factor of Samsung products has declined now that they are more mainstream
