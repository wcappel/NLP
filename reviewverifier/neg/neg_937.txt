It'll do in a pinch....but I hope there are better options. 

At times the sound is clear, however, most of the time the static is either 1) just annoying or 2) the static is so loud and piercing that you have to turn it off. 

I hope there are units that broadcast a stronger signal, or have another way to connect, in order to provide a constant tolerable sound quality. I would recommend spending some more money to get a reliable device.
