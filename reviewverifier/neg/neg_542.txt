This machine is  great looking, compact, and  seems to be the perfect combination fax/answering machine/speakerphone.  One major problem:  The phone is well below average in sound quality,  and the speaker is absolutely terrible.  The tiny, poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion.  The fax is great,  the print quality is great,  the speed is great, but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker  to hear messages.  This problem also renders the speakerphone useless.  I returned this unit twice thinking it was defective, but spoke to HP and was told that is just the way this unit works.  Buy the Panasonic KX-FHD351  if you  need a great sounding unit.  The only problem with the Panasonic is that it doesn't come in black,  but is a much better phone/answering/speakerphone.
