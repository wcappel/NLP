When it works, it works very well. But one day it suddenly died on me. I had a Comcast technician come and test my modem and after using some complicated equipments to test it, he concluded that the modem is dead. After he gave me another modem, my network is up again. Very bad reliability. MOTOROLA SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR QUALITY CONTROL!
