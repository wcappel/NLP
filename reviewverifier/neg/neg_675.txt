We ordered this radio to have on hand in case of emergency.  After an hour of cranking to start the power, the crank came off.  Got it back on, cranked more, came off again.  Small heartattack later from all the fruitless cranking, we sent it back the next day.  Looking for another option for an emergency radio, haven't found one yet.
