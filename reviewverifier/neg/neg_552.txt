I put this item in my cart -- it was one of the "buy both now" deals.  The problem is, the first item was sold by Amazon, with free shipping, the second item was sold by another company with outrageous shipping costs.

I caught this easily while checking out but just wanted to post a "buyer beware" to check the shipping costs
