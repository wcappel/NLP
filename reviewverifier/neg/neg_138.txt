DON'T BUY IT!   I bought a KOSS DVD player and it broke in 6 months.  I was told I was out of luck because the warranty is only 90 days.  They do not do repairs.  My only option is to buy a new one and wasn't even offered a discounted price for it.  I have seen several complaints like mine about KOSS on the web.  They make JUNK and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks.  Oh, by the way I loved it until it broke
