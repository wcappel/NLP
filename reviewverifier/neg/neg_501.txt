Very bad start, bad point for Amazon. I wanted to get a good quality device and that is the reason I chose buying from Amazon even it was more expensive than other sites. 
I just turned on the device and tried to search for broadcasts. It was like all the radios in US were shut down or at least in my region. By mistake I filliped the device and surprise: the device started receiving radio signal. After that everything seemed to be OK but some strange noise in headphones.   
Cons: failure/malfunctioning while operating the radio.
Pros: 	- great sound (with other than manufacturer provided headphones);
	- long operating time using rechargeable battery;
	- excellent expandable via SD cards feature;
	- I love the flip display capability.
I really love that device because of its features and I hope it was only my mischance getting a damaged one. However I requested Amazon the replacement of the device instead of reimbursement. I also already advised some friends to buy that device.
As a good point for Amazon, the very fast answer when I requested the replacement of the device. 
I will come back with updates after I receive the replacement. Hope a good one next time.
Thank you Amazon Team.

Coming back after receiving the replacement device.
First of all it was a very good idea buying Amazon fulfilled products even it was a bit more expensive than other sellers. The replacement came faster than the product. Excellent Amazon Team and very professional. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
The device works perfectly. 
Really a device you must have. 
More than that, my friends I recommended the mp3 player are very happy with their new acquisition.  They were luckier than me. 
5 Stars for the product now.
