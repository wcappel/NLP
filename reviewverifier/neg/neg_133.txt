Though I like the keyboard, I've found two serious problems with the mouse.  First, it is very sensitive to movement.  I've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control.  Finally and more importantly, the mouse burns a set of AA batteries about every 8 days.  I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life.  I've bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand.
