I've got an engineering degree in computer science.  I've been supporting multi-million dollar web applications for years.  It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.

It's not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you'd get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!

Player itself works fine
