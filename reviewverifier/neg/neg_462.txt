I was fairly satisfied with this phone until I had to re-arrange my office and move my phone.  Once I moved it and then tried to reconnect it, I no longer had LCD functionality or speakerphone functionality.

I looked on their website and this is what it said on their FAQ:

Problem:
No caller ID information received
Does the LCD screen on the handset show anything?
No
Your telephone is defective and needs to be sent in for service

Since it is on their FAQ I would assume this is a common problem.  In trying to exchange my phone they were insistent that I send my phone in first so they could look at it and then refurbish it / exchange it.  Since I use this phone for my home office this was problematic for me.  

I would not recommend this product.  I personally will not by Panasonic again due to the quality of customer support (or lack thereof) that I received
