This radio is poorly built. When you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out. You put them back in, carefully set it down, then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again...Now, I put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place....stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands...good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review...
