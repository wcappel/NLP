I bought this monitor in June 2006 and at first was quite pleased with the nice display. Less than 6 months later, in November 2006, I heard a strange noise while using the monitor and all of the sudden the screen went very bright -- like an overexposed photo. I'm currently working with Viewsonic to get it repaired (I must mail it to CA to be repaired, postage must be paid by me). All in all a disappointment and a hassle. Next time I'll buy a name brand
