Amazon does not ship to Post Office Boxes.  The mouse could ONLY be shipped to a post office box per Amazon shipping proticol.  Therefore, after TWO attempts to purchace this product from Amazon I had to buy elsewhere.  If you live where the United States Postal Service does not deliver the mail to your house, pass of this item if not Amazon.  I have considerable expierance buying mail order and online and this is the first time I have found a company setting rules that actually prevent the buyer from recieving the product
