Not a particularly easy lock to use (combo part rotates freely when not in computer, making it difficult to set the combo). Also changing combo is very easy to do accidently. However this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo. I am not a professional lock picker, and I am able to break the combo without any difficulty (which is a problem with many low quality combo locks, but this design try to avoid it at all). 
I've noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock "spontaneously" changing combinations. It's probably not because the lock  is defective. It's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage.
I would definitely never suggest this product to anyone (unless I really wanted their computer)
