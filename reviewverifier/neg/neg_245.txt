I wanted a keyboard that I could use in low light with both my PC and Mac, and this one is reasonably o.k. Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though.

But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life
