I did not read the prior reviews, I bought this item &amp; loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from Target.com.   The MFG SOFTWARE disc contains TWO VIRUSES one in Quicktime &amp; the other in Totally Hip files.  Target has been notified that the software is CORUPT with viruses &amp; that the MFG has gone out of business.  This item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no WEB SITE ACCESS or tech support available for this item
