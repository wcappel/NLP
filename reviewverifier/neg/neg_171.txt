I am a LONG TIME pc user and pc gamer.

I wanted this for a 
1. tv
2. pc gaming monitor
3. xbox gaming monitor
4. dvd veiwing device.  

Here is how I rate this monitor on these four levels on a scale of 1 to 5:
1. tv = 2
2. pc gaming monitor = 2
3. xbox = 1
4. dvd = 3

The ghosting for normal operations is almost too much to live with.  I returned this item just so you know.  The rca inputs gave me only black and white images.  This could have been because my monitor was defective.  I am not sure.

Ghosting during gaming was very bad.  Worse than that was it's lack of good brightness control.

This is not for gamers
