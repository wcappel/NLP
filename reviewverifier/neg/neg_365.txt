I bought this reader for my laptop since it didn't have USB 2.0.
But to tell you the truth, I think this device is a little slower than USB 1.0!  I am going to buy the Lexar 32Bit card and see if that improves the download speed, because this reader is so slow.
It took me about 45min to download 2GB of photos from my Extreme III card.  That is unacceptable
