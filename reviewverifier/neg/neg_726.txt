I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas. It was small,compact, and fairly inexpesive, perfect for a preteen. First, it took forever to charge (the instructions indicate that it takes four hours). After waiting for hours, my daughter attempted to take pictures, but the camera would not work. The manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the LCD display, but none of these symbols appeared on this camera. I am returning the camera immediately and I would not advise anyone to purchase one.
