Plays fine on the first layer. But picture will freeze during layer switch. I either have to stop or skip pass the chapter but picture will be jumping and pixellated, pretty much unwatchable.
you have to skip at least couple chapter away from the layer switch to get a decent picture on your screen.
don't waste your money. Buy verbatim instead. I never had any problem with that media.
