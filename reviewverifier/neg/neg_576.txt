Purchased the transmitter for my MP3 player.  Reception is poor with constant static through my car radio.  The instructions (which you don't see until you have already purchased the product) says antennas integrated into the window can have problems.  Since that is the only purpose for this device, I don't understand why Monster is selling a marginal product
