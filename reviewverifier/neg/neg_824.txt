Ok...it functions well as a clock radio.  Just fine.  Reliable.   But that's not too much to expect.  Yes, it will charge your iPod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually (though not gradual enough) gets louder.  The adaptor for my Nano fit fine; and I didn't find the clock too bright (it has 3 settings).  But the sound is really terrible.  It sounds like its coming from a transistor radio.    

As well, it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your iPod.  But as we know, you don't need a clock radio to do that--your iPod will do that on its own if you set it.  

I took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control.  They really sound better--I swear.
