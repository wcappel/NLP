you may notice i am writing this in lowercase.  i am using the s510 keyboard i bought over a year ago.  the shift keys suddenly went out so the keyboard is now useless. i have to subtract for longevity.  the mouse that comes with the keyboard is poor but i use it with another mouse anyway.  and, as noted in other reviews this, in common with most other usb keyboards, only works with basic functionality when hooked up through a usb kvm switch.  on the good side, the battery life is very good and i think it looks nice, but i'll be looking for something else for a replacement..
