This card is on its way back to Amazon.  I purchased it as it was one of the "recommended items" with the camera I also purchased, never mind that it doesn't work with the camera.  I'm not hugely tech savvy--I (wrongly) assumed that any items recommended with the main item (a $500 camera) would be compatible.  Check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to.
