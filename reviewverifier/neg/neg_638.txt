The Koss Pro4AAT headphones are quality headphones, but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv.  To get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about, you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp.  Also, the ear pads are of a vinyl-like material which doesn't breathe well, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  I've read that leatherette pads are available, but so far haven't been able to find them.  The warranty alone is great, but I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp
