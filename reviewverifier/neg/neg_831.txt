I had a previous good experience with a Jabra headset. This one was recommended for my Panasonic cordless phone by Jabra. However, the sound quality is terrible. It lacks any kind of high frequency response, and so sounds very boomy and full of bass, making it almost impossible to use. It also needs a foam cover, since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy. I contacted Jabra about this product, but received no response. Maybe it would work better with a different phone, but definitely NOT with my Panasonic
