I was in the market to upgrade my printer and used Amazon's reviews to decide on a Canon MP530. It does a good job, but when I plug the USB cord into the printer, the connection to the Internet drops every time. I have to disconnect from the printer so I can get on-line. Recently I filled out a rather lengthy application on the Internet and plugged in the USB cable so I could print. That step caused the connection to drop and I got to reenter all the information. I will be returning the Canon MP530 and start my search for another all-in one printer
