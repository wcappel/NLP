I ordered this radio back in May and I still don't have them.  It is now September.  I have exchanged several emails with Amazon, the first one I received a very nice but untrue reply.  The second response was borderline rude but at least honest, they told me that they don't have the product and don't know when they will.  If you are looking for something to use now, don't waste your time with ordering this radio
