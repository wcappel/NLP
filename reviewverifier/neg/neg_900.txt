I purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews. I, like others, cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on. I even tired using the "tricks" described in another review. 

To be fair, the product worked fine without wireless security, but I see little point in helping my neighbors tap my internet connection.

I am very disappointed in the product
