With a destructive toddler in the house I like to back up my DVD movies.
Having recently purchased a 25 unit spindle, I recently tried backing up several DVDs with my sony DRU-710A 16x DVD recorder.  Although the recording process initially did seem to work smoothly,  when I attemped to play back the disks recorded at 16x speed, I would have read errors and lockups on DVD players usually towards the end of the film (the outside of the physical disk, where maximum recording speed is obtained.)
   I did have better reliability recording at 4x speed and suspect that 8x writes will work fine as well.  Given the fact that I paid a premium for this new high speed media, I am disappointed.  I have had nearly 100% reliability with Memorex 8x DVD+R, recently making 25 successful recordings in a row with this brand (ASIN: B0001MKU4S
