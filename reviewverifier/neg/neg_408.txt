I went looking at Fry's for a mapping software and bought this before looking online at reviews.  I'm now stuck with a bazillion (ok, just 17) CDs and a product that takes minutes to load once you initiallize the program.  I still can't figure out how to access any info on Hawaii or Alaska and I'm waiting each time an average of four days before "tech support" haha will write me back.

Don't buy this.
