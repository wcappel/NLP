Very disappointing speakers!
Rip off.
I returned them. 

1.	Satellites produce static noise even with the computer turned off. You have to press the mute button to get rid of it.
2.	Extremely rumble base; not crisp. Even turned all the way down it is too prominent. Maybe good for war games.
3.	Missing mid tone. Satellites sound like they are coming out off a tin can.
4.	Volume is a bit underpowered. Will not knock your socks off
