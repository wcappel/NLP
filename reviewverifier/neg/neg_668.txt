We'll give the unit two stars instead of one, since when it does work, it works well, with nice print-outs.
But in a span of two+ years, its has needed its drum replaced three times.  And has once needed the main system/circuit board replaced.  We'd purchased this back when it cost about $125 more than it does now.  And the parts have not been quickly available from some vendors.  We should have bought the heavier-duty Brother 4750 which we use in another office, and has been flawless.
