Mine worked great for the first few months, then I started getting the "warning, check battery".  If you take the batteries out and reinsert, it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up.  It happened on both headsets.  I called customer service and they told me this is the first time they've ever heard that (uh huh - doesn't sound like it from the reviews here).  A little too expensive to replace yearly..
