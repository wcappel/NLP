Terrible product.  I have tried using the Windows XP wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the Netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers.  Using either one the card disconnects at random using WPA, then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back.  I reinstalled windows both times I changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it, but nothing helped.  Latest drivers are 2_0_0_7 and were published in Nov 2004, so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer
