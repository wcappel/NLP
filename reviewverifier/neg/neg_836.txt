Please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled "BEFSR41 v4 intermittent drop of connection" which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support, I'd post a URL but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon.

The only way to fix the problems that occur with this router is to buy a different model or better yet a different brand.  It appears that Linksys doesn't really care about the issue.  

I returned this router after the second day of dealing with it's constant connection drops and bought a Belkin instead.
