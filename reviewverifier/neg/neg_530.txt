I have had the 325 model for less than a year.  Up until recently I was satisfied with its performance using it to print less than 5 pictures at a time.  Recently, I needed to print a series of pictures (more than 10 in one sitting) and had an error message-print cartridge jam-I fixed the paper jam but continued to get the error message. I  called HP and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer.  I searched the internet for a solution only to find that others had encountered this and the solution was to purchase the "new'model- A not very cost effective solution as this was not supposted to be a disposable model.
