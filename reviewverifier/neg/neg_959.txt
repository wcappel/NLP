Since I first wrote this review I discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer.  After formatting my computer I was able to install the scanner and software without any problems.  I am still learning to use it but so far I have decided not to return it.  It works well and I like it very much.  I apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone's choice
