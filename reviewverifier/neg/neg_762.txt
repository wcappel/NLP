This would be a GREAT product is the chemical smell was not so bad and last so long.  It has a horrible smell that just will not go away.  I saw others mention the same issue but thought I would give it a try.  It smells.

Other than that, the comfort is great.  But I gave it 2 weeks to air out and the smell will not go away.  I would suggest you don't buy this is you have a sensitive nose.  It kinda smells like those squishy foam beds and slippers you see at Brookstone
