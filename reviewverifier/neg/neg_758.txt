I've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware, and multiple calls to D-Link support, and this piece of junk still does not work with the D-Link DWL-G700AP.  D-Link support calls are worthless.  As a computer professional, I find it appalling that D-Link would introduce and continue to sell this product, which clearly does not operate correctly.
