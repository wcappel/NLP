On the back of the package it says - 
 1) Transparent sound and powerful bass. - The "Transparent sound" part is true and "powerful bass" part is totally untrue.
 2) Metal stabilized system for high levels. - What was that again? Metal stabilized system?? It has antiroll crossbars I guess!!

When companies start making vague claims about their product - thats when you know that there is a problem.

These sounded terrible at first - no bass - period. 

The sound changed for the better once I put on the foam covers. I could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization, it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency, decent midrange but little by way of bass - even though it claims to have frequency response going from 18Hz to 20kHz. It fits my ears properly, so that is not a problem. 

This product sounds far inferior to a pair of "Aiwa" ear-buds that came with a "Made in Japan" walkman purchased in 1990!

I wouldn't even compare the sound of these MX400 to the excellent Koss over the ear headphones I purchased recently.

Maybe they are better than the IPOD headphones (which suck even worse), and the reason people give this 5 stars. Really - no more than a 2 star product.

Expected much better from Sennheiser. With this experience, I've decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from Panasonic. Reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplace
