I purchased the Zen Nano four months ago.  It was working then total system failure.  At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help.  The screen would flash on and then off.  It will not boot up.  Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed.  It goes in the trash.  In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored.  Also, the output volumn was to low.  I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task.  Now it is landfill
