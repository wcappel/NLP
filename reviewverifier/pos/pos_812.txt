This FM transmitter is the bomb diggiti!!  

PROS:  The clarity it great and the fact that it has a long neck makes it the best!  

PROS:  If you own a Chyrsler PT Cruiser, you will love this device.  The neck brings the IPod even with the top of the steering column.  So it right into view on the right.  You don't have to look down or fumble for you I-Pod in between the seats.  

PROS:  Very stable once it is in the outlet.

PROS:  GREAT reception!

CONS:  Would be nice if it had a on/off switch on the base for those outlets that stay on even when the car is off.  The green light on the device my attract unwanted attention.

CONS:  I have to take off my protector everytime I use the IPod in my car
