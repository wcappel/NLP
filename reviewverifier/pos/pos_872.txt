It also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time. I've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle (out of two that come with it) still looks almost full. If the price was a little more consumer friendly I'd give it five stars. I mean come on. When you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50-pack of CD-R's for less than $14, the profit margin on something like this is probably 200% or more
