Pros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small
Cons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. 

But overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it
