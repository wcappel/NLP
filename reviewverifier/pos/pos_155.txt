I have been using these for a while now and they seem pretty good to me.  (disclaimer: I am not an audio professional, nor do I have any expensive headphones to compare with.)

They have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...

I tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac, show as having 25-15,600 Hz (in my ears, your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.

They do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.

And, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.
