As the title states, this is an excellent wireless mouse.  Works right away with Windows XP, no driver install or software needed for two-button and normal scroll capabilities.  Software allows for extra button assignment, but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.
But as I said before, superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery, leather, my jeans, and thick carpet!!
