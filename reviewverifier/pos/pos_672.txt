I just bought a refurbished Roadmate 700 a few days ago. It took minutes to locate my current location, which was totally normal. 

I kinda feared that I would have the GPS with the older version 3.2, as some people said earlier. But in fact, the one that I got is with firmwave version 4.32, the newest version. The voice is working good too.

I am happy with this product, even though it is a refurbished one
