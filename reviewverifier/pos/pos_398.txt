I'm a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.
Well, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.

These speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative's corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative's SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)

Pros:

- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker
- No "wired remote" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)
- Nice design for the price
- Even cheaper than Creative's SBS 350


Cons:

- Small sub-woofer
- No "wired remote" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.
- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control
