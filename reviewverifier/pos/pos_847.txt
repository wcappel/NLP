I previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse, I can't
recall the brand, but it was awful (battery contacts wouldn't stay in contact
and it was hard to use).  I was using my laptop at my brother's house and he
lent me his Logitech V200.  It was AWESOME! Just plug in and use!

I went home that nite and looked it up here and saw that others had had 
similar experiences, so I bought one.  I've had it for about a month now
and love it.  The scroll wheel being able to lean left & right for sideways
scrolling is a nifty feature.

I recommend this product highly
