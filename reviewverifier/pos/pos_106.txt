I have only had this monitor for a couple of day's 
but I am verry happy with it. It came well packaged and you cant beat the price. I shopped around and this was the one for me.
I dont know about the other review but with in 5 min of opening the box I was using the monitor and it worked verry well!!
THANK'S AMAZON
