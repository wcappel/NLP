This is a total bargain. Not only was the price right, it works perfectly in the car, at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my iPod Nano. When they're put together it looks like one unit and if, by chance, you use a Motorola Rzr phone the charger works with he iTrip and recharges the Nano, eliminating the need for any other charger devices
