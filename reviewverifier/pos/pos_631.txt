The convenience of this product is terrific.  Whenever I show people how it snaps in half, they're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one.  Now that all computers have USB ports, I can put my photos into any computer anytime I want without worrying about the docking station.  A must-have product for every digital camera!!
