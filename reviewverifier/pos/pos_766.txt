Unit performs well, is reasonably fast, and has on-board security software that will allow the setting of a password.  If you choose this option, loading each time upon insertion is a little slower, and you must 'stop' the unit prior to removing it when operating under the password protection.  The few times I have forgotten I've not lost any data, but it scolds me for doing so upon the next use.
