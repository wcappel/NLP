MY HUSBAND & I SEARCHED & SEARCHED FOR DVD'S THAT WERE COMPATABLE TO OUR DVD RECORDED.  NO ONE COULD HELP.  THEN I THOUGHT, "I'LL JUST CHECK ON AMAZON," AND SURE ENOUGH THERE THEY WERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT A RELIEF!!!!!!!!!!  I WOULD HATE TO OWN A DVD RECORDER & NOT BE ABLE TO RECORD ANYTHING!!!!!

THANK YOU!!!
