I have this card for a week, and what I can tell you is that this card has a quality that I've never heard from any sound card - the sound is so clean, balanced and accurrate.
of coure, you will need a good set of spekaers.
the CMSS surround is much better than Dolby Prologic 2 and DTS neo 6 for both music and movies.
if you plan to connect the DIN cable for Integrated speakers control with the Megaworks or Gigaworks, you should know that it's not working, but Creative is going to add support for those speakers in the following drivers.
I didn't like the new 24-bit Crystalizer sound, but belive me you will not need that feature, just use good mp3 player like Winamp 5+ MAD mp3 decoder plug and ASIO plug for the output.
I had many sound card like the Audigy 2 , Audigy 2 ZS, Audigy 4 Pro, ESI Juli@, M-audio Revolution...
and none of theme even close to this card!!!
worth every $$$!!!!
I recommend you buying from amazon beacuse of thier great service and warrnty, I could't do that because I am outside USA
