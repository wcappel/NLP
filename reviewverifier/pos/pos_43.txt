I bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp.

The audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations.

No lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...

The only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press "SOURCE" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it's annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it's a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space
