I ordered 3 APC Back-UPS ES 500s on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at APC. I've had them for about a month now without any problems. They've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions. I'll gladly order more if the need arises.

Pros:
 - Large plug spacing, good for power adapters
 - Simple design
 - Long cord

Cons:
 - No line conditioning (usually an expensive option
