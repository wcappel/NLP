One of the best gadget-products I've ever bought.  The installation and connection was completely flawless.  It worked the first time and has been working since (and I even used the Powerline ethernet adapter to connect back to my router).  I have my cable TV on one input and my security system on the secondary input.  Using my cellular Data connection on my laptop, I can watch tv or look at my security system from anywhere in the country
