What a relief to find this mouse after having bought a Microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad.  I had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another Microsoft "ergonomic" mouse a year ago, which became chronic, but barely noticeable until I tried the 6000.

I also tried a Logitech V200, which is a good mouse, just not nearly as comfortable as the 450.  The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.

If you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers
