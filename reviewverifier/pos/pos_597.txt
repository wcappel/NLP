The Sennheiser HD 205 is great value for money.  The design is not only comfortable, but takes out a lot of ambient noise.  This headphone does not have active noise reduction but does a good job with its closed design headphone.

The right-side is able to swivel backwards, so you can answer a phone call and not need to remove the whole headphone.  This swivel was designed for DJ's to do sound mixing, but works well for other purposes as well.

I also like its strong bass and great clarity, where I could hear sounds in music that I did not hear before.  This headphones not only works well for music, but does great with your favourite action movie.  You will hear how close the sound is, and have bullets whizzing past you and swords meeting like they are just around you.
