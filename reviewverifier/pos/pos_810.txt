I bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it!  It has great sound quality.  I love the features it has such as speakerphone, caller ID, and it's phone directory.  The only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice-into both directories.  Oher than that, this is a GREAT phone.  I have owned panasonic and GE cordless phones in the past and had problems.  I even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone.
