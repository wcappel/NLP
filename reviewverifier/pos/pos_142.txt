(Despite some of the negative reviews of this item, it continues to perform well with my regular-sized iPod.  In fact, it has more volume, depth, and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which I've compared it.  The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its "bargain" appeal somewhat.)

These modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised: the sound is more than adequate; they're small enough that I can take The Stephen Colbert Report  with me on walks; when not in use, they fold up into a mini Porta-John. My only misgiving is whether I should have spent 2-3X more for a unit with a dock connector. But for under twenty bucks you simply won't find a better sounding, more compact unit
