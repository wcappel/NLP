We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office.  For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back.  It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
