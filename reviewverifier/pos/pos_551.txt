I just recently bought a Sony DVP-S560D model DVD player to replace my  older, more out of date player. I hooked it up, and to my surprise, it  wasn't any better than my old player as far as quality. Then I purchased  S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the  picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen.  The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by  component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are  considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of  only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality
