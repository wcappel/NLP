This phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones. The message center works well, and the intercom feature is useful. The phone is a little small, and similar to cell phones rather than a house wireless phone.
There are two generic rechargable NiCAD batteries, I think they will be easier to find than some of the packaged NiCADs that come with most wireless phones
