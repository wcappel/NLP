This drive is whisper quiet, easy to install and use, and in my experience, plenty fast. I recently encoded my CD collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files. I also used foobar2000/LAME to convert the flac files to MP3, all on this drive. During the process of converting the files, which is pretty IO-intensive, I found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate
