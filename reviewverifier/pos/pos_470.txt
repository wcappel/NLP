I have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps.

I am impressed by the softwares ability to "recalculate" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.

I am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc.

The real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco's endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!!
