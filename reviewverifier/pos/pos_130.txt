The reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...

I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.

Tons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  

Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.

Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.

Best of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.

The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver
