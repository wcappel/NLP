I burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors, even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.

I have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  

I've switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far, the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone
