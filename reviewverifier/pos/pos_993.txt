Note:  This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone & Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing).  It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one.

I'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip.  I initially bought it because I forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly.  I like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so I can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet.  I've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems.  I've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction
