I ordered this device to sit on a player piano, which can play ipod encoded MP3 files, once they are transferred from the special CDs that are designed for the piano.  The remote is limited, as are all remotes for ipods, but for the special use I have, this is a great product.  It allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music
