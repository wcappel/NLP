I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.

If cost is no object, then there are better remotes.  For the price, I can't find one better
