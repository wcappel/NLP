I'm going to cover compatiblity, sound, and comfort.

OVERVIEW.

Although I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD, $39 + $6 shipping isnt bad either. I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box, the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head.

I plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more.

SOUND.

Sound quality is excellent.

COMFORT.

The only thing I don't really like is this style of headphone. I don't really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.

COMPATIBILITY.

I have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.

FEATURES.

Coolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls! About 3X feet away
