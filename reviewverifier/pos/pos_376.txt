We have had this phone for almost a year and I love it. We have the base station which is also an answereing machine  plus we have  a sattelite phone.  I wish we had more satelite phones.  I love the talking feature because I just listen and know who is calling. I also love the programming feature.  I never have to look aup a tel number that I call regularly anymore. I just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on. 
Great phone buy it
