I think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable.  Mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where I can get an open computer.  I have W2K at home with USB 1 and XP Pro at work with USB 2.  Never had any type of compatibility issue.  This 128 MB size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion.  I plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon.

The amazing this is that I have just removed my USB drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle.  And this was the second time.  I can't believe it still works.

Maybe I'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck.

Through away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things.  Just make sure you back it up often
