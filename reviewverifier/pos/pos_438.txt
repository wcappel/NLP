I have had my Pocket PC for quite some time now, and I love the convenience that it offers.  

Plus:

-  Great color screen
-  Fast and easy to use.
-  Cradle adaptor is nice so you can able to sync files from pc to pocket pc.
-  Includes Word, Notes, Calender, Calculator, Recorder, Window Media Player, etc...  (HELPFUL)
-  Expandable

Con

- Although it is expandable, you can't use your memory card to do anything but save materials.  I am unable to listen to 256 mb songs... but i have to copy and paste song from the card to the pc every time I get sick of listening to the same song.
- Low battery life!

Other than that... it is great... user-friendly... and helpful if you are busy student or a college student...

I use it to:

1) types notes in class (why carry a laptop when you can get this)
2) MP3 player... besides the issue above, music quality is great... easy to transfer from pc to pocket pc.
3) calender and agenda... (keep important dates in check and be on tops of things
