I decided to replace my iRiver 190T after a 3rd party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the USB cable together.  I wanted USB 2.0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity, but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so I picked this up on sale.

I may still search for a used iRiver 190T after playing with the Lyra RD2315.  I like the ruggedness of the 190T a bit more than the RCA Lyra RD2315.

Pros:
User replaceable AAA batteries
Expandable SD slot up to 512 MB
Decent sound for biking and general yard work
Screen is able to be positioned at 0 or 180 degrees for easy reading from belt clip/lanyard
Line in recording and voice for short memos
3 different color backlights for user preference
Decent battery life

Cons:
Headphones are worthless.  Placing them in ear prevents clips from holding them in place
Slow reaction on interface compared to older iRiver player "Please Wait..."
Belt clip is going to break after minimal usage (like ink pen cap clips do)
Doesn't seem like USB 2.0 speed, just normal USB 1.1
No armband or case available

I used firmware 3.11 for my testing after upgrading from version 1.11
