I bought these speakers based on price because I just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater.  It turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price.

I really can't find one bad thing to say.  Even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound.  The sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass. Take advantage of the low price on these speakers, you won't find a better deal.

I'm using these speakers with a Harman Kardon AVR 240 receiver and I also have two Polk R15's as my front left and right
