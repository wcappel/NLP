The SanDisk 1GB Micro SD Card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging.  I installed it in my Motorala RAZR V3m as expanded memory for my music library.  Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access "My Music" using menu function #3 under "Get Tunes & Tones".  Function #6 "Manage Music" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with "MP3" player
