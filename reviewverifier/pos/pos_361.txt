For a long time I was looking for a phone to use with skype.  For the price and convenience, Actiontec Internet phone wizard was the best I found and ordered it from Amazon ($42.99 with free shipping).  After receiving the modem I have been using it for almost a month now and I am extremely happy.  I have connected my codeless phone to it and everything seems to be working fine
