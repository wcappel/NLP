After I read some folk's horror stories, I was really reluctant to purchase this device. Well, it took me only 5 minutes to configure the DWL-G710, and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house. It was really simple and it worked well with our Comcast/Netgear wireless cable modem.

Excellent product
