I am pleased at the sound of these speakers.  I feel that for the price, it was a good purchase.  The carrying case that is included is a nice addition.  You can use the included A/C adapter or run it on batteries.  Not only do I use these speakers with my iPod, but also for my Mac Book laptop.  I don't need an overbearing sound, but these portable speakers are just right
