I got this jacket a month into having my ipod.  I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop.  One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.

This case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.

It will protect your pod though
