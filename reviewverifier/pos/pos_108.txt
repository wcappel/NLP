I use the pink circles to buff the cd/dvd, and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd, as I thought it would. Well, I thought that those marks would disappear after I used the repair paste with the yellow circles, but they're still there. Is it supposed to be like this? The reason I bought the thing was to make the cds look like new, but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over.

Could someone answer this question for me please
