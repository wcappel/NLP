If you went to circuit city, you would see this is $30 there. Here its only 8.99! With fast shipping I only paid about $16 total, half the price of circuit city. Those type of stores (best buy, circuit city, compusa) are a total ripoff when it comes to these cables. Buy from Amazon.com (eektech will ship) and you save lots of $$. Thanks eek for great service
