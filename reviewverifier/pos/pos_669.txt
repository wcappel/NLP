The product was easy to load onto my Windows based computer using Windows XP.  I connected everything as instructed and as soon as I plugged in the TV cable to the back of the modem, My internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider.  

The modem comes with both a USB and 100T ethernet adapter port, so use whatever way works best for you.  I tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed.  I am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering.

Amazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping.  I ordered some stuff from them in the past and the free shipping seemed to take forever.

You may want to factor in paying the additional cost for shipping when buying this product if you need it right away. The price, even with the additional shipping charge is still a little less expensive than Best Buy.  The cost difference between buying it at a Best Buy store and Amazon online will not be much, and you'll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands, but you get to avoid the drive to the store.  I went this route, paid the extra shipping and waited for my package to arrive.  If time is not an issue, then use the free shipping method and you will discover that Amazons Price can't be beat, it is the lowest price anywhere.
