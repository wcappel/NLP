Look around in your local electronics stores and you'll find either HUGELY expensive players or single tape units.

This player allows tape-to-tape duplication as well as the ability to put two of your old collection in and listen uninterrupted.  Sure, it's not a 100-disk CD carousel...but how else are you going to listen to some of your best stuff (that you probably taped yourself?).
 
This, or the other TEAC dual-cassette units, should find a place on your shelf
