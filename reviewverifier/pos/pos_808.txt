Printers have gotten inexpensive.  Let's face it; the game is, cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills.  I'm fine with that.

For the $149 Amazon price, this machine actually *does* do everything I need it to:  a fax machine for those rare occasions I need to fax a physical piece of paper.  A great inkject that doesn't consumer *that* much ink.  It copies and scans.  I have used every function, am pleased with them all.

Sure, it feels a little flimsy; it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office.  However, it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months, so that flimsiness isn't really even a complaint.  And I work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month, so I am more than glad I can reproduce all the functionality my "real" office provides me.

All in all, worth the money
