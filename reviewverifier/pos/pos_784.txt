I bought this laptop stand when I found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so I could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them.  So now I have the center of the screens at the same height, side-by-side.  It is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate.

I figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen (like email) and use my big hi-resolution screen for what I was activly working on.  But, now that the laptop screen is up at eye level, I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor!  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it, even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised.
