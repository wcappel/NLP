I really likethe design on this Protector, and bought 3.

It allows you to plug multiple transformers in, and still have room for regular plugs. Slipping plus in is a firm push, but not that tough. 

I also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps.. Cool, but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn't have 12 amps to one plug..

The cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords, then wedges backin to hold them in place. A bit hard to set up, and a zip tie could achieve the same thing, altough this is way easier if you change things
