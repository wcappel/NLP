The first week I had these, the left earpiece's plastic "rails" which hold the earpiece in its slot broke.  The parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic.

Sound quality is great, with music playing and noise cancelling active, a normal conversation is barely audible in the background; great for crowded offices.  Battery life is good, I've gotten 24+ hours using a NiMH rechargeable
