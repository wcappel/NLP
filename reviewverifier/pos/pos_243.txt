I thought I'd weigh in, as the reviews suggesting noncompliance with Apple products seemed ominous.  I bought a Passport, and the USB outlet on my Macbook powers it perfectly well.  I don't need an external power supply.

Btw, I get a transfer rate of about 2 Mb/s, or 1 Gb/5 minutes.  This seems a little slow, but it doesn't bother me much.  The Passport is small, has a nice rubber coating to prevent shock, and overall is worth the purchase price
