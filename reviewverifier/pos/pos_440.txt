Excellent service, five days is all I had to wait and saved a lot of money. Couldn't be happier.
Im a new Razr owner so everything is new to me. CD installed without any problems (Windows XP). I had a cable so I now have a spair. I just wanted the Phonetools CD.
I would gladly do business again-Thanks
