I work for a small sized consulting engineer's firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles, old projects, letters from the client, books, etc).

We got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.

A couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.

PROS :
- incredibly easy to use ( you don't need to teach anybody )
- fast for PDF scanning
- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )
- very small, perfect for a desk
- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke

CONS :
- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.
- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).

I strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.

If you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better.
