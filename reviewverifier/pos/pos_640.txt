I bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint.  I use it in Chicago.  A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal, not true at all.  I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.
Overall, this GPS works perfectly.  The auto-reroute is fantastic, it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn, and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn. You will not be disappointed with this purchase
