This adapter is functional, is easy to use, enables continued use of backlight, and saves the batteries for walking with the eMap after arriving in a strange town. When I want to connect other media while driving with my  family, I use a 12v 3-Outlet Car Power Adapter. Despite another wire, it's a worthwhile accessory
