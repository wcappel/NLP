I bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items I need to carry back and forth (umbrella, lunch, spare battery, paper, etc).  It's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations.  Its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally.  I was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward, but it's not.

My only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days
