I purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you'll know when they're calling without picking up the handset.

Talking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it's a sales pitch or a call that could wait.

I set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. 

The phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. 

One suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays "recharge" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so
