I have a Gateway CX2610, and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes.  Enter this Targus lapdesk.  When folded out, it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours.

But wait, there's more!  I had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics.  However, I use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing.  It also puts the screen at a better height as well.

The desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode.  So, it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop.  I highly recommend it
