If you understand this product's limits before you buy it, you'll be happy.  It shows topographical contours, rivers and most streams for the entire United States.  In addition to that, it shows roads that were in existance 10-20 years ago.  These major roads are also named.

The limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.

The product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company's web site doesn't give a good explanation of what the software can and can't do.

You'll be disappointed if your expectations aren't grounded in reality.  Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available
