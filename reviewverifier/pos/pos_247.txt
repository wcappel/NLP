I had the previous version also. It is so far the best webcam I ever owned. Don't even bother to compare it with cheap creative ones. The frame rate and picture quality is awesome. Works in very low light conditions and has great software which can even make gieco or alien out of you. 

They keep on working for years. My old one "Quickcam for notebooks Pro" still a champion after use of 3 years now. I got bored and gave it to my uncle. And boy he loves it too. Newer one as mentioned by other reviewers holds much better.

Do I sound Like a logitech sales person? Well I must admit that I am very happy with their webcams. Amazon offers get price and you should get it.

One more thing. It's features outweighs its small size :). My Parents back in other part of world can see even tiny things in my room which they shouldn't :).
