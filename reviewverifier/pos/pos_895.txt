SanDisk has done it again.  They never seem to let me down with their products.  I was in the market for another memory chip since I kept filling up my smaller 128 MB chip.  The price was the deciding factor for me, as being a college student the financial situation was tight.  But this product was perfect, right price, excellecnt storage space, good name.  Get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
