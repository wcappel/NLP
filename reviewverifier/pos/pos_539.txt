I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. 

Overall, I recommend this product. It is a little bulky, but if you're someone like me who cannot live without music, it's a great product to have if you aren't going to be able to charge your Ipod
