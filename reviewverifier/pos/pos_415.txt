After having used CRTs roughly the size of small cars for my entire life, I finally jumped on the LCD-flatscreen bandwagon. This Acer 19" LCD makes me happy I did!

Mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn't wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size
