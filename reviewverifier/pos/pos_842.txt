I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.

Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself
