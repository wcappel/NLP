I wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days.
The mouse is very good, a tad small, but still very comfortable. Not as good as  Logitechï¿½ MX(tm)500 for my hand (I'd say I have a medium size hand), but still a very solid product. Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.
The keyboard is so-so. It is not bad, but just not very comfortable, especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines). The labeling is very small, Insert/Delete keys are not standard and I hate Vista ready button, if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash.
Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but with some reservations.
