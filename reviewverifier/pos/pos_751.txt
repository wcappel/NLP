Well, I have used 3-4 cassette adapters, till i heard this one, only words that i can say is you have to hear it to identify the difference.
i have been using it with my cd player and also with IPOD, with others i had to make sure that the volume on ipod was 100% but with this one hey 85% is too much.

Well i showed it to 1 of my friend and he also loved it, and took mine and told me to get another.

Don't hesitate to buy this one
