I bought my player Sep 2006 and the other region-free code did not work.  It is actually a DVD-224M (see manual) though it says DVD-224 on the player.  Here is how to do it:

If you have the DVD-224M model (says DVD-224 on the box, DVD-224M on the manual...), the hack is: 

Make sure you have no DVD in the tray. 
On the remote control: 
1) Press "TITLE" 
2) Press "1" and then "9" 
On the TV a large box with a small number will appear. 
The number indicates for which DVD region the machine has been set, for example "2" for Germany or "0" for no region code. 
3) Press the up arrow or down arrow to raise or lower the number. 
4) Press "ENTER" 
Done.
