I purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad.  It will run my cable modem, router, PC, and LCD monitor for 5 minutes.  This is more than enough time to save work and shut down.   Equally important, I know that my electronics are receiving clean power.

I feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply.

As always, Amazon had it to me in &lt;2 business days
