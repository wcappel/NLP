This was one of the cheapest tv mounts and it had all the options the expensive ones had it will pull away from the wall as well as allow the screen to pivot up and down.It also compacts up close to the wall.
I dont know what other features someone would want in a mount.
It is also very smooth when it moves and there is not any deflection or sloppiness in the construction, altough I only put a 14" lcd on it
