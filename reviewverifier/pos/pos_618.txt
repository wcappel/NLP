I purchased my first Roadmate in August 2004.  Since then I have taken it to various places in North America.  It's gotten me out of some tight spaces.  I've never gotten lost while using it.

I purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed.  I sent it in for repair.  (The extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier) The new RoadMate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since.  The old Roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week.

I gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since.

Pros:  Easy to use. Amazing detail.
Cons:  Sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellites
       Original mount is useless after about a month.  I got aftermarket
       tripod for each unit and they seem to work fine. Software updates 
       are expensive.
