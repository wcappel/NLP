Unlike many other cables that splice A/V output, this cable does so while retaining the details of that output.  I.e., both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted, not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono.  Also, it works on some computers, too!

On the minus side, I haven't gotten it to work on the television.  In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.

I bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.  For that, it was worth the cost
