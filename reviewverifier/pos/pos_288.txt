Delivered on time, no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn't want the default format it comes with, which is less safe). It's been running fine ever since I bought it. I can't comment on the speed of access because, since I leave it backing up over night, I don't really care. It's all done in the morning anyway, so I don't really need anything faster
