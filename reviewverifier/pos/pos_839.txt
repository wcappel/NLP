As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.

The only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  

Other than that, you have no excuse.  Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.)
