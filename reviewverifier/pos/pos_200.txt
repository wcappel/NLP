I'm very pleased with this camera.  I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.

Video calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.

This camera takes great video & photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don't use the face tracking.  

The base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering
