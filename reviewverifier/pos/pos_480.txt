When I purchased this product I was a little sceptical, however, once I unpacked it and started using it, it was so absolutely easy to use, and the pictures have such a fine quality, and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel
