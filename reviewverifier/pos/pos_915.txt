I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing "Bourne Supremecy" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.
As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product
