Nothing much to say about them.  They're high quality high speed rewritable discs that do what they are supposed to do.  I've been using these kind of rewritable discs for a while now and I haven't had any problems with them what so ever even when I burn at higher than 10x.  They come with cases too so you won't have to worry about scratching the CDs
