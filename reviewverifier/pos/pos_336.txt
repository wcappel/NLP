Researched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   
I mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn't be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  
I've also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There's also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  
The only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.
