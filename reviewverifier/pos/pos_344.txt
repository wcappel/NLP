I got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it's performance.  For gaming it's great, but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. 

The resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me, and if that's something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it's design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.

Design problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it's kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended
