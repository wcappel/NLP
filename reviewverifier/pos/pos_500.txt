I have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  

After about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.  

I needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it's better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.

When I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I'm looking forward to my next flight
