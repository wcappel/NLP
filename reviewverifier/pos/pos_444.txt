I don't get why other mounts cost twice as much.  I bought this to hang my 42" Panasonic and it is great.  Can someone tell me why the Omnimount costs so much more?  I don't see any "functionality" differences.  And with the Mustang Tilt mount, I have been tilting it at least 10 times for either adjustments or disconnecting/reconnecting cables...It is so simple
