We bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.

We liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.  This way, when he has to wait around, he will have something to do.  

CONS: 
- You should be tech-savvy to get one of these set up
- Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up
- Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model.  They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model.
- Since it became DISCONTINUED, it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat
- Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card
- Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon - why bother including this?

PROS
- Nice display and controls
- Came with mount and dock (some don't - you have to buy extra)
- We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield
- Also a PD
