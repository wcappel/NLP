I recommend these speakers - have had them for 3 months now and they are great - sound quality is great.  
Power converter gets pretty hot though so i suggest putting it on something non flammable - don't think it would catch anything on fire but just to be safe.  Speakers are not super loud but are great if you just want quality sound.
