This was part of my Stereo update. I selected this receiver for quality, value and ease of operation. I matched it up with the Sony CDPCX355 300 CD player and a fresh pair of those Bose 301-V speakers. Years ago I used to be an audiophile and I now think I'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby
