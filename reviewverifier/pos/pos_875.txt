Have been using them for a week now. 
Incredible sound for the size.  Bass is incredible.... mids are accurate, highs are accurate.  These are the way to go if you're using an MP3  player.  I use them with the Creative ZEN Vision M 30 ("The Ipod killer") 
 
While walking, riding a bus or train in in N.Y.C. seals out external noise amazingly VERY WELL!!!

Pros:
Awesome accurate sound / Incredibly light / don't protrude out of your ears / comes with "2 sets" of three different sizes of silicone  plugs / plugs are ultra soft, comfortable and fit perfectly / secure well built storage case / cleaning tool / barely uses battery power! / Not the yup-tard WHITE COLOR.... much cooler BLACK!

Cons:  None so far.

I bought them directly from Amazon for $75.99 with "free" 4 day ultra fast shipping
