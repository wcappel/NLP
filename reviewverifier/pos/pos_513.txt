Needed better protection than my $10 surge protector for my HT setup now that I have a couple DVRs & a plasma.  Filtering would be a nice side benefit too.  Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at (& now I see it dropped even lower!).

Pros: Build quality, fit & finish, plenty of outlets & diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs & meter.

Cons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed & are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers.  I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter.

Bottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon
