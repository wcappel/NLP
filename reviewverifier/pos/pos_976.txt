If you're looking for isolation from ambient noise, these are great. I use them as In Ear Monitors for my onstage use (rock band), and if I use the foam inserts, I can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off. 

I've read some people complain that the bass response is not quite what they expected, but frankly it doesn't bother me a bit.

The only thing that's awkward is removing them when they're fully inserted for a while. They're rather small, and getting hold of them can be a bit tricky. I'm using small bits of tape for "pull tabs", and it seems to work pretty well.

Overall, I'm impressed with this product since it's affordable and does exactly what it's advertised to do
