...what it has that the xr55 does not: HDMI, dual-amping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback, one extra set of component inputs, and all-channel stereo (called "party mode" on other receivers).  

Otherwise the internal components are identical, so expect similar performance---in other words, outstanding SQ when matched with the right speakers, blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand.  

See my lengthy review of the xr55 for more details.  

Boutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product, because it'd put them out of business...they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this Panasonic's prices, since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price.
