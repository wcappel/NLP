I am a camcorder buff. Ever since my children were born, I have 
had the camcorder attached to my hand most days because I know
that life is fleeting and memories are too precious to be lost.

I had a huge collection of video tapes and was able to transfer
the entire collection to DVD. Now I know that they will last at
least through my life time.. Also, I find that using the Showbiz
application, I can create customized DVDs for my friends and
that has saved me a ton of money in gifts..

The only problem we had with this product was that we had
limited hard disk memory and had to acquire some more. 
And I have probably created more than a 100 DVDs by now.

Thanks HP!
