I am a soldier serving in Iraq.  I bought an Ipod while deployed and figured it would get ruined by the dirt, dust and my combat duties.  I was fortunate to find the iSkin Eclipse.  It is perfect for this environment.  It completely encases the ipod to protect it from dirt and dust.  It also has a hard exterior faceplate the protects the ipod from damage.  

The Eclipse also makes it easy to use the controls; even when playing the new games put out by itunes.

To put it simply I am one happy soldier, thanks to the iskin Eclipse
