This is a great multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload.

Print quality is excellent, scanning quality is excellent, copying quality is excellent, faxing is faxing.

The control software is fine; not great, but it does the job.  The networking features, including built-in wireless, makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network.  

Some concerns:  after heavy usage the top document feeder, used for scanning, faxing, or photocopying a stack of loose documents, begins to jam.  The rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this, and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult.   

However, the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good.  

The fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can re-send them easily enough, but you can't re-print faxes received; the fax log merely logs their reception, but not the fax itself.

Overall it's a good multi-function at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it.  Would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load, with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement
