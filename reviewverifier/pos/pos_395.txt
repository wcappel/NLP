I have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).

PROS
It works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.
Easy to set up.

CONS
Once in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.
You need a computer.

In summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router
