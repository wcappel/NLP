Like most other reviews, I will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings.  What helped me is when I looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in.  Now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit.  Movies are amazing!  My music collection never sounded so good.  If you want to get away from it all for awhile, slip these babies in your ears and chill
