These speakers are awesome for the price.  They charge your ipod even when the unit is off.  The sound quality is great for around 50 bucks.  I bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room.  They also stack so they don't take up much counter space.  I can't say enough about the sound quality.  They are great
