I have paired this with my Linkysys wireless-g router and I have not had any problems with either. The modem installed without any issues. Prior to this modem I was using an RCA which began having connection problems. Since the Linksys install I have rock solid connection to the internet and a more stable wireless network. Previously I would expirience intermittant "drop outs" and would have to reboot. Currently I couldnt be more satisfied has been a good 3 month
