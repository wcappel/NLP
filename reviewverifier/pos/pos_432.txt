Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. 

I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.

The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL
