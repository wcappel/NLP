I got one of these a few years ago.  It's been to several countries, on camping trips, bicycle trips, subways, etc etc and held together very well.  I pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off I go, not lugging around a huge laptop anymore.

The typing is comfortable, this is just like a laptop keyboard, and while I too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring, it's taken a beating so far.  I'm buying another preemptively because I'll be so bummed when I do eventually manage to break the current one.

The hinge in the middle is annoying - you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap.  I think that when the new one comes, I'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever
