I ordered the apple ipod shuffle sport case because I wanted something to protect my ipod from the elements and just general bumping and scraping.  It works great, and you can use your ipod without taking it out of the case.  I haven't taken my ipod out of the case except to charge it, or to change my playlist.  It's a "must have item"  for anyone with an ipod shuffle
