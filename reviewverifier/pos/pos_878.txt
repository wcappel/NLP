I am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone.  It looks good, but more importantly, it feels good.  Button placement, weight, smoothness, everything was done well.  Coming from wired mice, the lack of a wire is very freeing.  I am also especially happy with how small the USB radio receiver is.  I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.

What's strange is I bought the S 530 desktop set for Mac at the same time.  The mouse in that set looks nearly identical (except for color).  However, it has a different weight and simply doesn't feel quite as comfortable to use.  It only fits the hand the same but once you move it, it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse
