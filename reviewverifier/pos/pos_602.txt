This was a breeze to setup, even with WPA2 to ensure privacy.  I also hooked up an Xbox360 and it has never failed in since I bought it about 6 month ago.

Much better value then your average gaming adaptor since it has multiple ports so you can hook up all your gizmos at the entertainment center rather then buying a wireless adaptor for each (i.e. Tivo, PS2, etc...)

I love it, and for the price, you could not beat it.
