As a journalist, I need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever I went. Now, with the Zen's microphone/recording feature, I'm able to use it to record my interviews, and it's easier to transcribe because of its clear, crisp recording quality.

You can also play .avi files, so unlike iPod users, there's no need to convert them in order to view them. 

Many might find it a bit bulky compared to the new iPod, but with its added features, it's a small flaw that's easy to overlook.
