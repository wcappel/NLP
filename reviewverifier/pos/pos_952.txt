Ok.. here's the deal.  I've been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years.  I love my Magellan.  I've never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built.  

However.... We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  
What I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  
I couldn't be happier with my decision.  

While I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS!  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It auto-routes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...  It dices....
Suddenly the Dark Side isn't so dark!!

This is a great unit that I would recommend to anyone.
