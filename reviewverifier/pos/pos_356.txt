The quality of materials: zipper, hard case, strap and light
weight are outstanding. When I connected my MP3 player, the
sound was impressive for a-carry along- portable stereo speaker.
Next, I took the MP3 out of the speaker case and loaded my DT
200V pocket radio; again the sound was very good and even loud
at a low volume setting. 
Now the minor negatives: changing the volume, etc. 
requires going into the zipped case. 
Other than the ipod, be careful in
selecting this speaker. The player, radio... cannot be 
more than 4" high, 2.5" wide and .75" thick; 
larger and you may not be able to zip closed 
the speaker case, which is necessary.
My items just do fit. So the Quality Sound 
and Materials make this a fine product, 
especially for the money.
