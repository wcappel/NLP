These headphones are lightweight, fairly comfortable, and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of $20 headphones I've ever heard.  Here are the aspects people always want to know about:

BASS: these don't pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I've heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.

MIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I'd never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.

These obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.  I should go work for these guys or something =)
