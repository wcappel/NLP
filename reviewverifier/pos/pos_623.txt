My old DVD would not play some of the many new formats, i.e. DVD-R, etc. This unit plays every DVD I've put in it with no hassles. The VCR has an auto tracking adjustment feature that seems to be fool proof, no stutters or static in the sound.  And the icing on the cake is the remote.  I understand it!  Plus it controls my television functions.  Excellent price and standard excellent Amazon service.  Well done
