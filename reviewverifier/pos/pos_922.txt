Purchase/Service:

For $2,200 at Amazon, this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2,700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping).  Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it.  And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.

Very pleased with the service part so far.....

My Set-up:

S6187 61" HDTV
Sony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn't sure it would work but there are three options to hook-up a home theater: 1) Basic connection; 2) Optical; 3) HDMI)
Sony DVD
Motorola HD-CATV box (We use Comcast)
Sony VCR

Experience:

As far as the tv, the HD channels look sharp and clear, however the non HD channels aren't as sharp as my 36" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 16:9, 4:3 and wide format; setting to 4:3 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little).  But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.

The TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu's are easy to navigate.  

The sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.

I like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up.  

I also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible!   

The camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.  It was a simple set-up, and again, the picture quality just blew me away!!!

I highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50" plus TV
