It's hard to believe the quality of the sound from this very small device.  MP3's sound great as do the voice recordings.  With 1 gig of space you can record an entire day of seminar speakers and still have space left.  The built in STEREO OR MONO mics are great...PLUS, YOU CAN USE IT TO CARRY FILES TO AND FROM WORK.

The function buttons are logical and easily accessed, even with my big fingers.  Priced right, I'm glad I purchased.  Received it on time.  Totally happy with my purchase.  

My only wish is that it came with a case and a neck or wrist strap.  It's so small it gets tossed into whatever pocket is available and that can lead to scratches from keys, etc
