The things I like most:

1. My recorded greetings (two greetings allowed) and my caller's messages are clear and clean. 

2. The unit's appearance and styling is sleek and modern. The controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top. My last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control. This machine is better in that respect. 

3. Learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines. The included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features.

Things I didn't like: Nothing, really. 

But some minor annoyances include:

1. The electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first. But I quickly "learned" its accent. Your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you. Otherwise, your callers will hear a default message in the machine's voice.

2. I installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into AC. Removing the battery, then plugging in the AC, then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally. The battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery
