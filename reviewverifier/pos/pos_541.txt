I'm really happy with this purchase. I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody (which is the media player I use the most), but it proved to work well with it. In fact, it works with all the media player I've thrown at it, including Windows Media Player, MediaLife, RealPlayer, iTunes, Rhapsody, DivX Player, WinDVD, and PowerDVD. 

All the buttons are functional (and I worship functionality - hence the 5 stars), although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work. No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click "Apply" and you're good to go a-browsin'!!

Battery life so far is really good - it's been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago, and still going strong. 

The RF range is really good, although admittedly my room isn't big enough to really put its range to the test. Dorm-dweller users should be happy with the range, though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie.

This mouse is also great looking; not cheap-plasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control, but as a mouse it's really sturdy and ergonomic. 

I can't comment on installation since it's been a while since I first used it, but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I'm sure I'd remember.

I'd second the other reviewer's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse, and this fantastic mouse doesn't come with a cordless keyboard... But it's a great buy, all in all
