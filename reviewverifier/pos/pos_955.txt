I've never written a review, but I've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers, so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review.

I know experience and taste vary by individual, but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint.

Pros:

- Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking
- Size - very portable; some may find it too narrow; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse
- Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I'm a fairly heavy user
- USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging
- Product Design/Quality - Nicely engineered; good quality material- not tinny - it's built to take abuse

Cons:
- Haven't really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don't tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward.


If you're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one.
