 i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup.  the sound quality wont blow your mind, but it does not sound bad.  its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price. it has a switch in the back for outdoor/indoor.  not really sure what that does.  very easy installation with the brackets included.  (no screws provided) overall great unit for thye pric
