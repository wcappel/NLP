After ordering non-OEM inks from several different places on the web (and having some problems with them), I discovered that Amazon sold OEM at great prices.

I went to my local office supply store and purchased a complete set of 5 inks for my Canon Pixma iP4000 at a cost of $75.  Later that day I found them on Amazon at almost 1/2 the price!

Also, when it comes to OEM inks, I discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions.
