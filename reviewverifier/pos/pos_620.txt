This charger is designed for every iPod EXCEPT the Shuffle.  The Shuffle connects via USB, this charger uses FireWire.

Every iPod charges while connected to a computer via FireWire or USB 2.0, but this charger allows you to charge your iPod in a wall outlet.  In addition to the charger you will need a connector cable.  You can use the one that came with your iPod or buy a second one.  Hook 'em up, plug it in the wall and get on with more important things while your iPod charges.

For international travelers, the plug pops off and you can purchase the correct plug for the country you will be visiting.  Great feature!

I have an iPod Dock connected to my stereo and use an extra connection cable along with this plug to ensure that my iPod doesn't run of of juice durring parites and long playing sessions.  I highly recommend the Power Adapter to iPod users who want the flexability to use their iPod on the road or in conjunction with a stereo
