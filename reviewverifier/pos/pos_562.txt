This card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.  

512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera, assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time.  With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting.  Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you, but I've had no problems with SanDisk products
