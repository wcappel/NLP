I have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well.
It lives up to its claims. The "face tracking" feature is not always fast and accurate, but generaly works (in good light).
This camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results, but then again what camera doesn't.
Image quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device
