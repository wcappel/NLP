This little doohickey is exactly what I needed to read my memory sticks.  Load the software, plug it into the USB port and you're off and running!  The MobileMate is SUPER SPEEDY!  The files/pictures pop right up with no lag time.  And you can read all forms of memory sticks with this one reader.

Excellent value for the price
