I'm a D-Link refugee and this card has been just great. My home connection has been very good, I'm in a basement and have no idea where the router is!

Swapping wireless networks is a breeze as I travel around - it can be easily configured to automatically find one wherever you are.

Very reliable, quality construction, easy to install and no problems with W2K.

This is my 2nd Netgear card; also have the FA511 wired adapter about which I can say the same things (except the wireless bits).

Definitely recommended and worth the extra cost if there is any
