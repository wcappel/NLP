I have been using my Sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures. I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently.
-use MTP music files because they use less file space.
-adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory.
-use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra).
-use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra).
I do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest, and the large amount of memory the video consummes.
This player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center.

I think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades.

The only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control.

I am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon.
