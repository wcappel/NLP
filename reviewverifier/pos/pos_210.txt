About 2 1/2 years ago I finally got into the digital age.  I began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there (Kodak, HP, store brands, etc. etc.).  By far, the most superior paper is Canon.  They make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints GREAT photos.  

I did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they'd hired, which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper.

I'd highly recommend that people use this brand.  You won't be sorry
