This backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my MacBook safe. Its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything I need. As a chronically disorganized person, the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings. The strap is nicely padded and it's elastic, so shocks are well absorbed.

A nice touch is a zippered 'cavity' at the top, which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger. 

The build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product. I've always had good luck with Wenger products in the past. 

The best part about this backpack is that it doesn't scream 'There's a computer in here!'.
