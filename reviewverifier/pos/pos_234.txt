For the background, I've owned & used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:

Pros:
1. Very good bass & well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)
2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)
3. Very light weight
4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)
5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &iM716 have better isolation)
6. Moderately priced ($50)

Cons:
1. Cables are thin so handle with care.
2. Some people may not like the "phonendoscope effect" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.
3. No pouch or case
