I found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far, other wireless solutions have been marginal. I really wondered if the Ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the 802.11G would really work. 

So I get my new Extender kit, unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions. Lets be real, this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs, it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit. I can highly recommend using this product as the primary connection or as I did, extending an existing network without having to pull cable or put in multiple 802.11 bridges
