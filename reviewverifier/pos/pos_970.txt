Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one.  Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
