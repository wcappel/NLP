I've used these (and similar) cases for years.  No problems, even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them.   
1) I've never had one crack. 
2) They hold the disc securely, but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it.
3) As long as you open them properly - from the front (clear) side by pulling near the corner(s) while holding the back (colored) side - they open fine
