Corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days.  My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.  Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house
