I have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of &quot;over-the-head&quot; headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price
