I purchased this hub back in September. I plugged it in and I'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment, I've had no problems. It doesn't take up too much room even with 7 ports.

My only complaint isn't with Amazon, it's with D-Link. After I sent in the rebate info, I got a card from D-Link saying my request wasn't valid because I hadn't purchased it from the right store. But I called them, and in about 10 minutes I had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later. I HIGHLY recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info, just in case..
