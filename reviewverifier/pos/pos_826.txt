The camera is perfect.  If using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you.  The picture is clear not to grainy.  The only heads up is lighting.  Try to use the camera in a well light area. We are stationed in Japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home.  The camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick.  The best part is the price won't break the bank
