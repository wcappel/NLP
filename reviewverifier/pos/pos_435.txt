I'm not much of a techie.  But, I do have lots of documents and pictures that I can't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day.  

I used to back up my most important files on CD: an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time.  But, with this 2GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize.  The files are copied over to the device quickly, and easily.

The 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  
 
ScanDisk even includes a "Synch" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.  (The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages, folders, appointments, tasks, and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive.)  

Also, I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine.

Physically, the unit is small, sleek with a case that feels substantial.  The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use.  

This thing is great.  I only wish I'd started using it sooner.
