I'm a section editor at a high school newspaper and I have used this drive every day both in that class and in all my others for over a year and it has never let me down. It's small, sleek and elegant and has a quick transfer rate.

The only issue is with the caps ans skins, which get annoyingly loose over time. I carry it around on a little pouch on my keys that I keep on my belt loop. When I pull it out of the pouch it will sometimes pull off the cap and skin. It's a minor annoyance for an otherwise great flash drive.

I just went out and bought the 1GB version and I use them both
