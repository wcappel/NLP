This phone has excellent voice quality, including in conference mode. The only reasons it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that :
a) it is unable to operate if there is a power outage - as opposed to perhaps just losing some of its functionality . Just make sure it isn't the only phone in your home.
b) there is a bug which occasionnally renders it unable to operate. I can't figure out what causes it. It may be my cats that walk on it at night and press a weird sequence wit their paws :). The only cure I have found is to pull the power plug, which reboots it
