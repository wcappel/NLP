ok mimo is becomming popular ....i dont give a darn.

my home net work relies on a cable modem(moto4200)+wlanRouter

my house is 2 story high and it's made of steelbar re-enforced

concrete... with brick wall here and there...

since the internet performenc is lower then 9mbits max...

all i wanted was penatration through the concrete floor..

i 'v used pen type? usb adapters and so on ...but they were

always short in range ...but g120 was another demention ...

allover the house allrange !when i put this close to the wall

adjacent to the negihbor's house, i was able to update my 

neighbor's router firmware (i've done it twice already)

speed is not the main concern in my case .

but you guys should know about it's response speed . its a

little slower then pcmcia types even if i use usb2.0 connection

but i think thats because my lap top is running xp-pro on

celeron 800/256mbram. as long as you have a good pc 

(faster then mine~!)

you wont have any problems. it's not that hot dont worry!

i wont give this product 5stars because it's not small enough.

who needs mimo. !

ps: use the zero config not the stupid utility
