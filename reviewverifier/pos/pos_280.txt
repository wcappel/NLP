This Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here's a list of the other things about this phone that I like most:
1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.
2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don't have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.
3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.
4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.
5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.

However, there is something about this phone system that I don't like.
--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.

But overall I think the phone is a good buy, if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset
