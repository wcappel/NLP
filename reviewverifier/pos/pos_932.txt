This printer was purchased for my wife's birthday and arrived
in two to three days. Considering money spent the printer
works quite well. Pictures come out very good overall. An
HP 95 or HP 97 cartridge is used for color photos. It contains
three color inks but no black. Still, photos will easily 
satisfy the average owner. An HP 100 cartridge can be used
for black and white photos. Yes, the color cartridge must be
exchanged for the black one when converting from color to
black and white and vise versa. Even so, we find the printer
fun and very simple to use. Just keep in mind that the price
of ink will soon exceed the price of the printer if used
often. What we do is use it for special occasions or when
the grandchildren come over.
