I work in a computer lab where we constantly re-image devices (using Norton Ghost).  I have 3 laptops and 1 DELL GX620 desktop and all of them have Gigabit connection.  When I connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous, I get the same performance (0 differences) as I run 1 laptop to the GX620.  This testing was done with Cat5 cables that I pick randomly from my lab.  I can't wait to add more devices and using Cat6 cables to get my work done faster
