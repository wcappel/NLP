This is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.  The joystick is easy to move, which is nice in a close dogfight.  I am very glad that I bought this HOTAS, because I have had NO problems with it.  I highly recommend this system to anyone
