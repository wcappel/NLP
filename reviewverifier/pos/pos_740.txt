Lenmar Is great to work with, When Beach Audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment. Beach Audio told me I would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that I had to purchase. POOR RETURN POLICY. So I just sent it to Lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one. Only took one week to get it. GO LENMAR.
I've been able to watch on a 10in. Portable DVD Two (2hr) movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare. ***NICE BATTERY***
