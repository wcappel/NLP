Overall, a good phone. Low cost. Well built. Many features.  Speaker works OK for the price.  Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries.  As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often.  This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model
