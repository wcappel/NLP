I am very pleased with my purchase of the Envision EN-7100 monitor. It arrived in perfect condition, no dead pixels. I resisted spending the money on a new monitor for a long time, but now I'm glad I made the switch to LCD. The color and clarity is wonderful. Most of all, I love having all this extra space on my desk. For the money, this is a great monitor
