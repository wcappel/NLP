I also ordered the Antec SX-1030 (which has yet to be shipped! arrgghh!!). According to Antec, the 1030 includes 2 fans, but has space for 2 more, which is where this one comes in! For those of you wondering what size &quot;small&quot; is, it's an 80mm fan. Good airflow (don't know actual CFM) and pretty quiet
