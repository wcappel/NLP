This is a great little piece of hardware. 

I bought it for my MP3's and movies, and I'm very pleased. It's totally "plug-n-play"; there aren't even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. 

It gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I've had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I'm very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn't even give me any noise! It's as silent as a fart, and that's a big plus.

I found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you're on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate's 300GB is also highly recommended, as I've worked with it before. A+
