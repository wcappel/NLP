I've used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.

The only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected.

All in all, a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination, and one I am quite glad I purchased.

Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body. 
But rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming,

"WOW, Lord! What a ride!"
