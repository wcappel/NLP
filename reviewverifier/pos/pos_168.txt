I've been slowly making my way to the Mac side after nearly 15 years of unadulterated Windows/DOS use.  The process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of Apple products:  High and Scarce.

The best thing about Apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me, and if you have a problem, someone else has most likely had it, too.  Those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor.

I had been looking closely at the 23" monitor.  When I read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use, I realized I would either wait until Apple re-engineered the monitor, or look at other options.

With the 20" Aluminum, I didn't have to look far.  I wanted a monitor that would compliment my G4 laptop (Powerbook), but I didn't want to break the bank, either.  The answer was turning to ebay.  $600 out the door.  Mint condition.  Saved over $150, and the monitor works and looks great!

The 20" and 30" models have had no problems.  If you can buy them new, go for it.  If you can buy new, but would rather spend that extra money on something else, check out the ebay auctions
