On the plus side, it's a great value for the games that do work on the T5.  SimCity alone is probably worth the price.

On the down side, although Amazon claims it's compatible with the "Tungsten Series" that was probably written before the T5 came out.  Four of the games appear to act as "trial" versions, although it's impossible to enter the registration codes.  See (...) for an explanation.

Even with only 4 working games past the trial period, it's a good  buy.  Just know you're not getting what's advertised if you have a T5
