I had an iPod for about a year, and had a lot of problems with it, having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired.  After the third time, I sold it to a friend and invested in the iAudio instead.  This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats.

I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this.  The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p.  It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money.

Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up
