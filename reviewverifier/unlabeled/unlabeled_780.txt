I was surprised how tough these little critters are.  I got it initially because I did some travelling and needed something small and light.  My 2 boys (3 and 5) started using it (because it fits their hands) to play games and I wasn't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it.  You know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games! To my surprised, its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day!  I bought my wife one and she loves it and I ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes.  Yes, it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job.  I even used it through one complete code/programming project
