 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true. 
 My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster. 
 One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me.
 I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none.
