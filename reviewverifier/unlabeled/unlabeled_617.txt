I just ordered, but do not yet have my 1080p Sony Bravia XPR2 tv and my Dish Network HD package.  So what I am watching at the moment is a Sharp Aquos 26" 720p-ready tv.  I took the Sony dvd player out of the box, connected the HDMI connections to the player and to my tv, turned the player on and put in a digitally mastered retail dvd.  I didn't even have to open the operating instructions booklet.  The picture is so incredible that it makes it hard to watch regular tv with my non-hd tv Dish Network receiver.  I played a musical jpeg slideshow made with Memories on TV and burned onto a DVD+R.  Not only were the 6 megapixel pictures beautiful, but the HDMI connection gave me the full quality of the sound, even without a surround sound setup.  I then tried a movie slideshow made with an old version of Roxio.  The player actually improved the look of the little movies taken with an old Sony still/video camera.  These were very grainy as they were not really dvd quality.  They were over 100% improved when played through the dvd player.  Installation took about 2 minutes (because my tv HDMI connection is in an odd place).  I highly recommend this playe
