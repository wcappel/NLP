I had a 512 simpletech card, and loved it.  I got this 1gb card a week ago and it has worked great.  The 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years, and so I purchased from simpletech again.  The card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures I have remaining to take, unless it is on the highest setting.  It says I can fit roughly 950 pictures from this 3.0mp camera on the highest settings, but I have not been able to take that many yet!  Batteries only last for 300 pictures, so I probably don't need a card this big.  It is nice for videos though, and it can hold about 15-20 minutes of video at 640x480 15fps.  It also seems to write very quickly.  Much quicker than my lexar card.  For most users, I would suggest having 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb.  Don't keep all your eggs in 1 basket
