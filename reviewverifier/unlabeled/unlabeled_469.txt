I bought this TV in March of this year (2006) and it has worked perfectly until the Sony Techs came out and "updated" my firmware.  I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty.  As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on "high" and is loud.  This did not happen until the software was updated.  I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work.  The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced.........  Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty.  I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered).  Otherwise, the TV is perfect
