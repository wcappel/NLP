I have an earlier version of this program and the antenna. It works well in the car with my laptop. I did not have the trouble others had with service. I ordered their latest version of their 3_D Topo map program. It was scheduled to be shipped in late March, 2001. I had an immediate need for the program and called them. I talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to. I asked for a Beta version to use until the new version was released. In less than a week I received the full version (not the Beta version). You can't get better service. Every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily
