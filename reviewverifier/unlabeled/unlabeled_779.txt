I have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop.  Look/feel and general use are fine for short periods of time (~&lt; 1 hour).  However, I am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem:  Intermittently, after clicking/double-clicking, the mouse will go into a "move to the left" mode...and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen.  Sometimes it will move to the upper-left.  This is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable.  I will often (at least 10 times in a 30 minute period) have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing.  Frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi-level menu, for instance.  Another example is if you working on any CAD-type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time (mouse will move when it feels like it).

It was ok for a while, but now it is annoying...going to buy a replacement.

If I have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life, it gets no more than 2 stars.  It could be just this one particular mouse, but then that points to lack of QA at the manufacturer end...again, 2 stars
