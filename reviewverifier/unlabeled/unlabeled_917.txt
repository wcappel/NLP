I have no complaints about Amazon on this item, but I do with Sony, because their Memory Stick is not "regular" sized.  It does not fit into my HP memory stick slot, so I have to use a cable connection with my Sony Camera.  My previous digital had a standard size memory stick that slid right into my computer.  I gave that camera to my son, who loves that feature also for his computer.  It's strange to me that Sony would choose not to be a standard size in this memory stick business.  It just does not make sense to me.
