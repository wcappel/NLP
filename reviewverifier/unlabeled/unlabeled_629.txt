This product worked perfectly transferring to the computer and then using the included software to put several home movies on one DVD.  It also worked perfectly to transfer directly from VHSC tapes to DVD without transferring to computer.  Very simple set up and instructions.  The quality of the transferred videos was excellent!  You can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply.  With the included software, you can do or add just about anything, music, frames, voice, etc.  No problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use.
