After going through more than ten different manufactures of DVD+R media I have to say I have had the best results with these.  Close to 100% burn rate with excellent playback on most players, except Sony, (though I'm using a Sony burner).  One batch had some duds at the end of the cake and Amazon replaced the whole thing promptly
