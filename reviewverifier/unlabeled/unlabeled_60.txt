I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate
