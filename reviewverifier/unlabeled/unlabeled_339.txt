I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button.
