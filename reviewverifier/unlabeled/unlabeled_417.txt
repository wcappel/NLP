I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.

I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.

To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.

I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.

For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.

Not a quality reader.

Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.

Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.

Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.

Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
