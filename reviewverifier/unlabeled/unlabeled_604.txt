My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port.  I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC.  If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it.  There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers.  Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed.  I should have researched this before the purchase.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing it.
