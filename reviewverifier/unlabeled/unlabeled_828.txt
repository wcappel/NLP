I bought this Belkin Battery Backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by MS Word's AutoRecovery feature.  It's worked fine at warding off power failures since, I haven't really tested how well it does what it's supposed to do.

I do have some comments on usability.  My wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds counter-intuitive.

I would like the non-battery backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so I could shut everything down for power conservation with one step
