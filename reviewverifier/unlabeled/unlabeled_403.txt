I have a Sony DVD player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time, and would still be good today if functioning. 

Recently however, it was seriously malfunctioning.  I would put a DVD in, and it would keep spinning, but then not recognize it at all. It would recognize and play CDs, but they would skip constantly. 

I decided to give this a chance for $5 to see if I could recover my player. I ran it once and it seemed to skip less, but would still not recognize DVDs.  I thought , maybe if I put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work.

Voila!!! I couldn't believe it, DVDs were recognized and played again.  So give it a try, maybe run it a few times!!!
