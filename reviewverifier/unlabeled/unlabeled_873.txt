I bought this DVD burner because my friends all told me that it was a great burner, and I compared it to other specs of DVD burners without breaking the bank, and by far, this burner was the cheapest and was the fastest of all the cheaper burners I could find.  I can burn a full dvd in 40 minutes, 30 minutes spent reading the disc, and 10 actually writing it.  It works great with my Memorex 16x DVD+R's.  I loved this burner so much, that I bought another one, so I now have two burners in my computer.  I highly recommend this burner and the nero software that comes with it is great
