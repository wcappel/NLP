No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
