This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs.  It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders.  The page holders are easy to put back in.  It saves space on your desk.  I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks.  It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find
