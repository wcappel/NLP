As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars.  However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them.  Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no "universal speaker mounts" will work with them.  If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting.  Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design
