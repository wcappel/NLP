With my five megapixel Leica Digilux 2, this Lexar one gigabyte SD card will give me 244 color photographs at the highest-quality jpeg setting! That's equivalent to ten rolls of 35mm film. The write time is (to me) quite fast, so it really performs. So far, I have not encountered any problems with this SD card. And if it stays that way, I'll get another one.
