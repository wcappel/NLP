We had purchased a DVD recorder and within 5/6 months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor, I contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last 5/6 months.
We bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly. I will recommend anyone having problems with their DVD player/recorder to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as I was about to do.
