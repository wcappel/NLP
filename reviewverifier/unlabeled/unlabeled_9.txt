I've had my Wave CD storage rack for almost 5 years now and I'm more than happy with it. It's been moved around, bumped and wedged between pieces of furniture, yet it has held on quiet nicely. I was originally attracted to it's wavey design which for me, is more artwork than just another storage case. I plan to buy another one
