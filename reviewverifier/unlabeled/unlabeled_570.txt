I bought htis accessory because I do not fancy pretty much the neckstrap. I hate to feel my neck aching after a while due to the weight of my 10D plus battery grip and lens. I rather to carry it in my hand instead. So I thought this handstrap would give me the extra safety feel I was needing. 
After receiving it I noticed it is only intended to be used with "grand cameras" , like the EOS 1 series (film or digital) or to those other series cameras that already have a battery grip attached to them. Fortunately that's my case in which I always carry my 10D with its BG-ED3. I tell this since a 10D, 20D, DRebel or 350D body does not have a strap eyelet on its base. Only their compatible battery grip has it. 
So be aware that this nice, safe and comfortable accessory could not be attached to your prosumer camera if you don't have the corresponding BG.
