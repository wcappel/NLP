I bought this "dream system" to compliment my Samsung HL-R5087W 50" HDTV DLP television.  If looks could kill these two products together win hands down.  Overall I am pleased with the system for the amount of money I invested for it.  Sound is decent.  I feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with Monster Cables.  As like many others thoughts I was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and "wireless" seemed to be the answer.  Problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a WIRE.  So if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because Sony has figured out how to eliminate point A to point B but point B to point C remain dreamless
