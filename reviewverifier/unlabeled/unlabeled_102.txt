if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the  best quality possible.  i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD.  The quality is outstanding.  

2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things:

1)  setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure.  the message should have said...."MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD"....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on.  easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple.

2)  on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video.  This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors.  


this is a great product....don't look any where else
