I should first note that I am no expert on television sets, and was more than a little confused by all the different technologies out on the marketplace.  After some research, and a little help from a local home theater company, I settled on this TV.  If 13" of depth isn't an issue for your application, this TV offers picture quality on par with the more expensive plasmas and lcds.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase
