Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.

Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack.

Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff
