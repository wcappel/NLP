I just purchased this unit and once I finally got it working I could not be more pleased. Just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away. Maybe I just have some &quot;funky&quot; wiring in this house, BUT I had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit I wanted in the master bedroom while I tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work. All the electrical receptacles work fine, so I don't know why it did not work on the first try. Once working they are great...just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine. I'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a &quot;hard wired&quot; system
