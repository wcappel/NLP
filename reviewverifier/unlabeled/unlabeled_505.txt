I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05).  It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird.  The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music.  Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty.  The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one.  I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.  

I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano.  It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner.
