I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are.  However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks.  [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.]  I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it.  If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away.

My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid.  I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need.

[My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them.
