I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page.  I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page.  Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it!  It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well.  It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised.  The stand is adjustable.  It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it
