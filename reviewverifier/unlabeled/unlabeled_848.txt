       AA Batteries sure come in handy around here. We have seven battery operated clocks and all seven use AA's. We also have Remote Controls and a small radio plus other items that use AA's. Now you see why I bought this 50 Pack. The expiration date on my 50 pack is December 2011 and I bought  these Batteries from Amazon a few Months ago. For what I use these batteries for; they are holding up great. Priced right too. Definitely worth it!
