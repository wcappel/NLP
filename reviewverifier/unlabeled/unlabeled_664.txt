I'm a digital media student and freelance multimedia artist, and my mom is a retired commercial artist.
We both bought the tablet after putting up with the Aiptek version for a year.

Cons: The included mouse doesn't have many of the movement control features of a regular mouse. I'd recommend using a normal optical mouse along with the tablet. Besides, you're not buying this for its mouse.

Pros: Loads of included software (that you'll actually use), perfect compatibility with Adobe Photoshop's features (a huge discount for Adobe Photoshop CS is included), surface is washable and scratch resistant, no batteries required, awesome sensitivity at any pressure or angle, two pens in one (top of pen works as eraser tool in Photoshop) and above all, it's the industry standard choice. All other reviews will agree. There's no better tablet, and I stand by that. I've used it with everything from Adobe Photoshop CS2 to Adobe Illustrator CS2 to Macromedia Flash MX to Alias Maya.
