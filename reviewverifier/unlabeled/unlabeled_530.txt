Having owned this system now for a couple of years I have had my ups and downs but overall I am pretty happy with it. For the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers. Yeah! On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem). Overall, my music sounds crisp and I love hearing every little noise in my music, so I still have a smile on my face.
