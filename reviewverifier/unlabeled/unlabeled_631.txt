I was very excited about this unit when I ordered it, but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate (VBR) encoding, and the DivX recording feature didn't actually work most of the time.  (A blank screen or a green screen was the result.)  Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit.  I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software.  It seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image.  Too bad...this one really had a lot of potential
