Supposedly someone listened at the Logi office of the NASCAR MOMO discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price.  That does not excuse this exorbiance.  The clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand(or foot).  This wheel and the transmission (hump) style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first re-action, the console buttons are only useful, again if the game doesn't back out of it.  Hard Truck series backs out of any digit button or other past # 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions. One would usually need this for race car games, but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs.  However. in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time, the extra buttons are redundant gimiks.  The styl'n Corvette style trans-hump shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at (stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect) and the gear can shift better than a rudder(better used as a turn signal) other than that, either go down on price or give us key-to-button config in games that do not support it.  Heel-toe shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch, how lameo is that
