The software provided with the unit worked well, I bought another mp3 player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer.  The menus are easy to use, and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the Sansa MP3 player will automatically shut off if you don't hit the play button again.  My only complaint is the unit eats a lot of batteries- it is best to go with rechargables.  I get about 6 hrs playback time per battery.
