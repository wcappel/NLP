This tiny piece of plastic with metal contacts packs more whallop than you could imagine.  Sure, memory geeks like me may find little things like this more awe-inspiring than the next...but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek.  What this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures, movies, ringtones, etc. over a long period of time...and then you can "dump" it onto your computer.  The other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your phone..
