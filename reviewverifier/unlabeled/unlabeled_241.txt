Other reviews mention three cup sizes. More specifically, there are *two* cupholder inserts (small and large), a special bottom attachment (for either of those) to be used in adjustably-sized cupholders, plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability. That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need.

And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt.

Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car
