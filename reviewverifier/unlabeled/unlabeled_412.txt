Logitech scored a big plus with this item.  The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly.  The first review is really unfair.  Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous.  Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did.  Good job on this one. I recommend it highly
