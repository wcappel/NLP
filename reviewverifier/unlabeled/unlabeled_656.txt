Overall this product is worth the price.

Overview
To begin the footprint of this particular tablet is 17 5/16 X 13 1/4
so you have to have enough desk or table space to accomodate it.
The overall finish and quality of the tablet had some issues; mainly some rough casting of the clear plastic on the top. Ergonomically it feels at home placed on the lap with the dimensions making it quite stable.  The express keys feel solid though I don't use them as much as the quick keys.

Performance
Though I am a relative tablet novice I have taken to the Intuos 3 better than I have with my sibling's Intuos 1.  Pressure sensitivity can be adjusted to suit one's tastes making the tablet itself quite responsive.
the pen is light but solid.  I prefer the black felt tip stylus point rather than the standard plastic.  I have laid a sheet of vellum (thick tracing paper) over the tablet in order to simulate the sensation of drawing on paper (i prefer some resistance.)  The pen reacts the same as if the vellum weren't there.  The 9x12 image area allows me to use my shoulder for more fluid movements when I draw and does not feel cumbersome at all.  However i have not used the tablet mouse, it feels rather heavy and does not glide across the frosted plastic plate due to the layer of "felt" underneath the mouse. Installing the driver software is a snap and the customization menus are easy to understand.  NOTE: the option to switch from portrait to landscape (9x12--12x9) is available in case you're wondering which I was.

This tablet has made me more efficient and more productive.
