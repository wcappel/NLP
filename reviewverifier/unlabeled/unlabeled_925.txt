It has become nearly impossible to find a compact stereo of any quality with a cassette deck and an Aux input. I mean what is with the marketing hype these days of "MP3 and iPod compatible!" All you need is an aux line input for pete's sake. My old JVC purchased nearly 20 years ago had aux in and with the help of easily found adaptor still plays all my iPods just fine. But, the belt drive on the tape deck failed twice and repairing it is no longer an option. So, we bought this... and it works, but the build quality is less than stellar, the sound is simply ok, and the remote works provided you have a clear line of sight to the unit. But all that, given the price, i think it's a good deal. Hope this helps
