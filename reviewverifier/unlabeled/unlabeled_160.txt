I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws.  The power button is the only thing on the remote that works.  None of the other controls on the remote work.  Second, it's VERY BASIC.  I would have preferred something that had some "sleep" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control.  The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked.  Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck.
