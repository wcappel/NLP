I installed this controller on winXP.  While I was playing an emulated game I noticed that my keyboard didn't work and there was no way to exit out of the game (alt+enter) to minimize the screen.  So i reset the computer and now the keyboard doesn't work at all, must be something to do with that installation CD.  I recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual, on creating a restore point, that you can go back to, incase something like this happens
