Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE!
