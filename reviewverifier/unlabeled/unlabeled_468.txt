I got mine locally for $1100 dollars.  The going rate was 1399-1599.  I saw it at a competitor for $1198.  So I went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another $100 off the price for HDTV installation.  What a picture.  I started to get turned off by sony because I had 2 32 inch CRT's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners.  But I remained loyal and I'm glad I did.  I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away.  I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television.  I'll take my chances on this one.  Hopefully bulbs will come down too.  You'll love the picture with or without HDTV.  I love all the features and they're pretty intuitive.  There probably won't be too many left.  I think they're phasing the model out.  Not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it.  Sorry about the other bad reviews here
