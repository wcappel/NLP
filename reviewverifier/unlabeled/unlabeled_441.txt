Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue
