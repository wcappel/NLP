I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up
