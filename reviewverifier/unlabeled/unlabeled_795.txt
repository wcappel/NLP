I recently purchased an Alienware computer with a Dell 30" monitor and wanted speakers to match.  I wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when I play games or watch DVD's.  These speakers are the loudest I have tried.  The shake the walls and house with great sound.  Some important "pro" features I really like:
1- the speaker cables are clips rather than RCA plug type- in other words, I can use my own speaker cable (I need long ones to route the surround speakers) to make it a professional installation (all wires hidden).
2- each speaker volume is adjustable.  Because of my room size, i manually turned up the surround speakers volume to balance the sound coming from the front.  
3- the remote is really cool to adjust volume quickly, just point and turn it up
