Very easy to install, I'm not very hardware literate. I have used it to copy music with the cd-r and movies with dvd-r so far no coasters. It has done more than I expected and no problems. My only complaint is it doesn't have light scribe like the European models. Highly reccomend this to anyone looking to upgrade their computer
