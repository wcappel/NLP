I have never had this device fall over like others have complained of, either.  Granted, I do have mine situated one a hard wood floor but even so - it seems sturdy enough.

It is a little irritating with the wave structure how some of CDs won't fit but other than that I find this tower really helpful.  It's a nice and fun way to store your CDs
