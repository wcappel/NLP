The CD trays are a little flimsy, but this audio system really packs a whollop. The sound is excellent. For the price, it has a lot of features, such as Bass/Treble control, a sleep timer, and five CD trays. To get an enjoyable sound, I'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break. I just try to be extra gentle with the trays
