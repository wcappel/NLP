Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit.  Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels.  Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly.  Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned.  First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five.  CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use.  Will think twice about buying a JVC again..
