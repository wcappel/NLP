This is definitely a great investment.  I can take as many pictures as I want to and not have to worry that the stick is getting full.  I have two sons who also like to take pictures and in the past I would have to take my pictures off the stick so they could use it to take their pictures because the stick we were using had less memory and got full really fast.  Now I can leave my pictures on the memory stick as long as I want to, until I'm ready to download them or delete them. Everyone should start off with a 1GB memory stick because it's convenient and really worth the money spent
