I'm amazed... simply amazed.  The price is way out there... and this obviously isn't for everyone... but it does everything it says... well.

Set up is super smooth,  get the manufacturer and model number, type it in during set up on your computer, and it is done.  Thats it.

I do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well.  And then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well.

Tip: Don't buy their lighting controls... WAY over priced.  Anything that is Z-Wave will work... Leviton sells a line for 1/3 of the price
