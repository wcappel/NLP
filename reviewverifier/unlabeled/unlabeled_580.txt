Memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and I bought two 50-count stacks of these because they had a great deal going on. In a perfect world, I would have gotten the same deal on 50-count stacks of Maxell dvd blanks. They are the best but you'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best.
