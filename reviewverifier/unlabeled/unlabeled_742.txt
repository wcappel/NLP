First off, I don't give 5's for anything.  If you expect this remote to be able to duplicate your other remotes based on a predetermined code for the manufacturer of your equipment, it won't happen.  It works for some but not all and didn't recognize most of mine correctly.  However, it has the ability through computer hookup to learn all of the functions that any of your remotes have.  Takes some practice and bravado but will work.  My wife loves it and won't let me put the multiple remotes back on the coffee table.  If you are computer literate this thing is amazing.  The two downsides are 1) It is heavy.  You're not likely to hold it in one hand while lying on the couch and flipping around.  It pretty much has to sit on a table.  2) The keys that appear on the RM-AX4000 screen can not be renamed so if a key name doesn't match one on your remote, you'll have to remember what you programed the key to do
