SD cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems.

I don't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at Disney took place. I had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera (which I have since trashed for this incident and bought a new Nikon) but anyway I had over 300+ pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of DisneyWorld. I cried.

So as a suggestion...clean off your Memory cards after each event and don't go for the 512MB or the 1GB cards unless you are putting video on it or etc. 

Now I am a happy person once again since my hubby's going to take me back to DW to replenish those missing pics!
