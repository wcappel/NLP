I have several Sandisk products USB Compact Flash and SD, have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days (10MB & 15MB cards)  Have allways found them to work great and a good value (dollar cost) for the quality.  The new ultra II SD card is my second SD, also have a 256MB card (also Sandisk not ultra however)  These cards work well and keep on going like the Duracell Bunny!  There are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality
