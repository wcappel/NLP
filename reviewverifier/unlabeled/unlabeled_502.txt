Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right!  Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle.
Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it
