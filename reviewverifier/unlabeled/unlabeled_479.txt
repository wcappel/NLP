I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. "Okay" I thought, "I must have got the one bad one..." So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the "radio stations" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are "just not tuned in right" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the "station fuzz" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage
