I own 3 compact flash cards by viking and bought them in this order, 128Mb, 256Mb, and recently 2Gb. I have never had any problems with any of these cards and have always looked for Viking Compact Flash cards whenever I needed any.

This 2Gb card works perfectly with my Ipaq pocket pc storing a variety of files from mp3 to mpeg (video) to word, excel, and maps for my pocket pc gps system.

I did try a Lexar card once and found it did not work with my pocket pc as well as this one as not all the files on it were recognised.

I will always buy Viking compact flash
