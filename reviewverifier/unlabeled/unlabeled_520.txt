I have been using this transmitter with my IPOD photo for a few days. This stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough. I tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough. If there was an interference, all I have to do just re-setup to the empty channel. This stuff will overpowering the other channel if available. The only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter, it will hard to re-open again. It might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful.
