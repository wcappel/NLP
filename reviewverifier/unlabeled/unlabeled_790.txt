Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better
