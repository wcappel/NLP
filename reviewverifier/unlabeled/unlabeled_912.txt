I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo
