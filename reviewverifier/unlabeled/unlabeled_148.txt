The Dazzle 6-in-one is perfect.  I have used it to transfer photos/files from my husband's camera (Sony Memory Stick), from my camera (ComapctFlash), from my Ipaq (SD card), and will try it with my new camera (SD card).  It's is way easier than bringing the USB cord and each camera with me.  This is one of the best purchases this non-techie has ever made.  (I have had this for over 2 years with no problem.
