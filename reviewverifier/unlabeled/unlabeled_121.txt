I just purchased a set of two 4 channel Westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently.  If I tipped one of the units, it worked sometimes, as though it had a bad connection.  I am trying to return them now to the seller.  Good luck if you purchase a set of these.  They seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set
