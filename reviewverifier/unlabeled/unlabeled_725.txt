"I was replacing a portable Sony devise that I really liked, but busted one of the speakers. This is a very attractive unit, with excellent sound. I can even plug in my mini disc player. It is very portable with a nice black bag. I was very pleased at the sound of this small unit. Includes earphones, an adapter to play other devises besides IPODS and Universal outlet (powers up the IPOD while playing)...also runs on 4 AA batteries."
