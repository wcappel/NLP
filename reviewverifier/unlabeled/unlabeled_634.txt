We bought this printer to go with the canon G2 we bought.Excellent choice.First I must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than Amazon[.com],DON'T.I have dealt with Amazon[.com] for years and they are the best at what they do,no one comes close.The printer is so easy to setup,not like some of are other printers.We are using Window XP,it went like a breeze.in lees than 30 minutes I was printing pictures.... I am still learning all the features,but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any other.. And it is fast fast,printed 2 4x6 pictures in less than 4 minutes,I have found that you do need to buy quality paper.I used the Canon 4x6 bordless paper first until I ran out, then I switched to another brand,big mistake.Use the right paper and you to will be amazed
