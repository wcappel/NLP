The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer.  The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem.  Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit.  I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service
