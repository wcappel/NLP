I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore.
