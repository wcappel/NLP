Pros: it's pretty

Cons: it's garbage

Sure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage!  So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)

I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.

Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere.  If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy..
