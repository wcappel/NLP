I was scepticle at first that something looking that flimsy could really hold the weight of 622 cds.  The assembly was easy though time consuming.  I would recommend that you use those plastic washers, otherwise if you decide to move the rods you get nasty marks on the wood.  I would recommend this unit  to anyone wanting all of their cds in one spot.  Very stable even on carpet
