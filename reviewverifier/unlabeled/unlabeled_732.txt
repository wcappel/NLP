I got this for free (after main-in rebates) when I bought NEC-3500A DVD-rw drive last Xmas time.  I started using these very recently (15 days back or so).  I have burned about 25 DVDs so far and all of them came perfect.  Not a single item is wasted etc.  May be some of the credit goes to NEC DVD-RW drive.  I am very happy with it - so, I got another 50 pack from local Fry's for about $20.00.
