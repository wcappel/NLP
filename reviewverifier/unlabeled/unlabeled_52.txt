Compact, portable and works with all the popular media cards: cf I/II, sm/mmc, sd/xd and mms/mmsp. I have one at home and one at the office, both you can take anywhere and doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to use, plug & play. Nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed. The lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader, a nice angle for putting in the cards.

I got mine for less than $10.00, so it's definitely worth it! Lexar has great quality and good design. Highly recommended
