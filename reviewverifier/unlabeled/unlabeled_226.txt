When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great.

What I've read in other reviews is very true.  Having them seated in your ear properly makes ALL the difference!  I don't normally like things inside my ears, but I pushed it in farther and made them seat right...and now...VERY nice.  Not as loud as my other pairs of headphones...but they don't need to be.  They also cut out like 25-35db of outside noise...which means you don't need as much volume.  I've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though I wasn't listening to music at the time.

I hope you enjoy them as I do
