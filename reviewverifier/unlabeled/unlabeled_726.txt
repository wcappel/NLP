I purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation, and boy was I happy. the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it's own case.  The extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in French Polynesia to charge our ipod, and since the speakers work with 220 voltage I did not even have to get a converter.  Outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems.  Most importantly the sound quality is great!!!
