I just ordered the second one for our family.  It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould.  They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use.  The software is simple.  The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time.  My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have.  Mom loves that they're affordable
