I am not going to rehash what the other comments have said.  Most that mention pros and cons are accurate.  Here is my addition.  Joystick is not as good as the Ipod.  On the other hand, the Ipod was designed by Apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a PC.  I have not even installed any software to use my iAudio!  I use it as a hard drive, Mp3 player, and sometimes I record radio shows to listen to later.  I got the 30gb for extra storage.  The iAudio seems to be quality made and doesn't scratch as bad as my son's iPod.  I would buy this product if I had to do it all over again!
