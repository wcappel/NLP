I have three of these CD towers, and in general I'm very pleased with them.  I like the wave design, and they hold a LOT of CDs.  I don't mind having to take off a whole stack of CDs to get to the one on the bottom, and as long as you balance the distribution of CDs properly, they don't tip that easily.  I always place mine next to a wall, anyway.  My biggest problem is that they are sometimes very difficult to put together.  Of course, that is only a temporary issue, although an incredibly vexing one.
