This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device.  I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery.  I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing.  I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable
