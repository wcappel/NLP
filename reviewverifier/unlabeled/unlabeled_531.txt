SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers.  That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers.  This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here.  I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future!

BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service.  Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! Lol

Disclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product.  Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH  No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true
