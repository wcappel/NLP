This little hub is just about everything you could want it to be. It's extremely compact, I don't think it's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port USB hub. At the same time it's also very solid and feels durable. The hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod. A handy LED light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer. I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but my ipod updates at the same song-a-second rate as it normally does when connected directly. I suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit, so that you cannot have 4 devices transferring at the full USB 2.0 transfer rate at once, but that's to be expected. This would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports, or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system
