I tryed to use this on an older p4 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording (loss of frames).
Then I broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all.
The S video from my old High 8 Video Cam came out perfect.  Sound was perfect too.
The point is you MUST have the power.  I do not care what the manufacture put on the box.
I would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what I had to use to get the results.
