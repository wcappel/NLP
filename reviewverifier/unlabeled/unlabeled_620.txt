I'm not sure what happened with flagday1960's APC UPS, but I have had mine for over 2 years and it has performed flawlessly.   Whenever I've had an electrical power outage, the APC's software notifies me that it has reverted to battery power, and informs when commercial electrical power has been restored.  I can view the stats for my UPS - when and how long the last "event" (battery power activation) occurred, and the UPS current charge status.   My 350R has only 6 outlets - 3 battery/surge and 3 surge, the current 350 model provides 8 outlets - 4 of each.   While I can replace the internal battery of my 350R when it does die and is unrechargeable, I'll likely buy a new 350R in the near future, primarily for the extra 2 outlets
