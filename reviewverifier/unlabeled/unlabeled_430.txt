They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up).
These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used.
The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.

I am going to return these package to Amazon.
