This is the second Wacom tablet I own and the third tablet in general. The other wacom is the 9 x 12. Which, at the time, I thought was the greatest. And the Hyperpen (my first tablet for a starving artist)... well, don't. Don't buy it. Stay away. Horrid thing. Save up and get a small wacom.

With the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right. The size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors. And, with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area.

The touch stripes are useful but really not necessary. Only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability. 

The 6 x 11 is just about perfect
