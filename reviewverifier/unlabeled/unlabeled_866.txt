I have used three other brands of 16x DVD-Rs and none of them have been problematic with my new (Tivo) dvd burner. This is the first brand that just hasn't worked. These discs were a waste of time shopping for, they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns, and they were a waste of money. I am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the Amazon marketplace since it wouldn't be fair to other buyers. For your information, I have had no problem with Sony, Fuji, and Verbatim
