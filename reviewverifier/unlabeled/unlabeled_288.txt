I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.
Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here
