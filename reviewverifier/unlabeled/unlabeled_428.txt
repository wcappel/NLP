I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.

I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD.

I would buy these again.

I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product
