I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work.  Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely.  It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them
