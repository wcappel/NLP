I already knew how good this product was before we bought it.  We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer.  I have recently learned I might have been able to have that replaced if I had thought to follow up.  But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer.  When ordering mine, the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one, I got free shipping, I never even had to leave the house!  I couldn't be happier!!
