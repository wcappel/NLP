If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit.  Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well.

* The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders.  
* The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles.  
* The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod.  
* The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod.  It actually holds the iPod well.
