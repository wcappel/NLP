Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price
