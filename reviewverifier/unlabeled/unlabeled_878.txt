I thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old MHC-GX250 which was a bit big for my new smaller room. But I was the MHCEC70 Minisystem is truely "Mini" and inferior in quality to the older MHC-GX250 which was around $280 and was well worth it. This system does not deliver the 320 Watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room. Moreover it lacks an auxilary and Game Sync, so you can't hook up your TV, IPOD or XBOX to it..
