While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else
