For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised.

I bought this system probably a month or two after it came out, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I owned an apartment and wasn't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand, so this system fit the bill quite nicely. Did I know I wasn't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience? Of course I did.

The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video. I only wish it had Component Video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there I was kicking myself... and still kicking myself.

For those who complain that it doesn't play all videos, I will say this. I have also had issues with it not playing videos. What I discovered was that it wasn't the DVD's but the transfers or the video type. VCD has issues, SVCD mostly plays and of course every commercial DVD I have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the DVD itself, like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface. Bottom line is that when I keep my DVD's clean, my Bose system is friendly. 

If you've got bootleg DVD's, don't expect them to play in your Bose DVD, they probably won't work. More to the point, they probably shouldn't work becuase you shouldn't buy bootlegs anyway
