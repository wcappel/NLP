+ Great sound quality
+ Powerfull enough to fill my living room (though probably not with 25 people in party mode) with a small footprint. 
- The remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv. (Probably because the remote is tiny and only has a watch-like battery, so not enough power). 

Overall, very good quality for a reasonable price.
