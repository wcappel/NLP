My husband told me he would like a Sony RM-AX4000 Home
Theater Remote Control for Father's Day. As Father's Day
approached, I realized I couldn't remember what it was
he'd asked for, so I asked him again.  I was nearly out of
time to locate this product, but I checked Amazon.com and
they had them listed.  I ordered one and had it shipped
quickly, but I didn't think it would be in time for him to
open on Father's Day.  The package arrived on Saturday, the
day before Father's Day, and Amazon saved the day for me.

Thank you Amazon, for all that you do!
