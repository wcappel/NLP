This mouse is great for laptop use on the go. It comes with me everyday on the train and on buses on my way to work, and still works with no problems after a couple of drops and banging into things. My only complaint is the dimensions on this page are way off. The mouse is very small, for my hands I basically use it with 2 fingers, but it works great!
