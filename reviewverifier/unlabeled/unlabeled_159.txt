I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap. 

I think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using. I was out of the country but I still wish now that I wouldve taken my "heavy" adaptor with me. You live and learn. I guess everyone has special needs, but in this case I can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night.

So, these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right. Packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system. Its ok, Id give it more of a 3.5 star if I could.
