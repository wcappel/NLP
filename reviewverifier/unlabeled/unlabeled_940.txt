Great disappointment. Plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications I own (Excel, Word, FreeHand among others) and displayed typed numbers (when it did) with extra spaces and squared characters. Should specify in the product description that is NOT MAC compatible. I'm not aware if PC users faced this problem as well
