Hi,

Hey, don't run to the repair shop just yet and don't kick that DVP/DVR to the curb too soon.......help is on the way!!! My DVR was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until I fed it this Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. WOW, it worked like magic!!! It's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day I purchased it. If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents.
