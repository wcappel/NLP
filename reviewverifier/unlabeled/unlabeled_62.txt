I also bought this item.  Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC.  Rebate denied because UPC was not included.  I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it .  Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained.  To date, have heard nothing from them.  I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC.
