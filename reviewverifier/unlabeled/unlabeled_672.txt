I love these cases.  The colors are nice, the see-through feature is helpful, they keep my DVDs and CDs clean and are great for mailing, also.  Not one of mine has ever broken, but you DO need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them (I can't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it, bent one severely, or beat one to death.)  They are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial CDs are packaged.  I always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case
