This system is not the most sophisticated or powerful you can buy, but it represents a great value for the money.  I've had no trouble operating it after a reasonably quick and simple installation.

A great feature is the multi-disk changer.  After you've tried it you will wonder how you did without it.  The ability to move from disk to disk without having to re-insert them is a huge conveinience factor.

Highly recommended
