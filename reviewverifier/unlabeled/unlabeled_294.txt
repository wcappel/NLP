I have had this for about 2 years and I travel about 100 days a year by car.  I have it hooked up to my laptop, which is on the passanger seat.  It has never left me down.  In fact I would be lost without it, literly.  I tracks where I go anywhere in the US with the existing software.  Nothing else to buy !!!  It pinpoints where I am at anytime.  It's GREAT.  If you travel a lot like me via car, and have a laptop, a VERY GOOD, AND LOGICAL PURCHASE
