I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH TV NOT TURNING ON, AFTER HAVING PURCHASE A YEAR AGO. FOR ALMOST YEAR IT WORKED GREAT !!TRIED ALL SOLUTIONS GIVEN TO ME, AMAZON WAS HELPFUL WITH CONTACT INFO.  IT TOOK ABOUT 2 WEEKS TRYING TO GET SERVICE,  WHEN SAMSUNG COULD NOT FIX PROBLEM, IT WAS RESOLVED BY OFFERING TO SEND ME NEW REPLACEMENT, THIS YEARS MODEL.  I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH SERVICE
