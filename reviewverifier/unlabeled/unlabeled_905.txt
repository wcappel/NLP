There's not really a lot to say about this product - it protects your nano, the material is good quality, it is not too thick (doesn't bulk up the nano too much) and not too thin (provides enough protection).

I wanted this to go jogging with my ipod - it fills that function perfectly, the strap is comfortable.

The only flaw that I have found (this does not bother me, but I know it might bother others - hence 4 instead of 5 stars), the material does act as a bit of a dust collector - if you put it in a dusty packet, it will collect a lot of dust.
