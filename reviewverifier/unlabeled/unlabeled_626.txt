I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Only mpeg capture device I have tried that gives a good quality picture.  Any other device I tried only worked converting to avi's, if at all.   Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  If I use S-video instead of composite video, computer locks up (but that may be a problem on my end).  There are 2 different capture methods (Capwiz and Ulead's Video Studio).  Sound was a bit behind using Capwiz, use VS instead.  Would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable, but now I am just nitpicking
