After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a  running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car.  These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty.  They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs.  Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper.
