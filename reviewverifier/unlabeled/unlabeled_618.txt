I bought this for my computer, and it is useless.  The unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine.  Be very careful when purchasing these.  I would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend.  APC has offered to give me a discount on a new one if I use this as a trade in, but it would cost me a fortune to ship it.  Tiger Direct will (according to the website) only guarantee items against defect.  Therefore, I'm left with an expensive doorstop.  Don't make the same mistake, research before you buy!  My 19" monitor and Pentium 4 are too much for the 350VA
