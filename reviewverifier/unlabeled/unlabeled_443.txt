Easy to use, and fairly easy to set up.  However, as stated in most previous reviews I read, initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use.  Wish that macro creation was more detailed; for example, more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a DVD, including ejecting and closing the DVD tray.  Pleased with purchase
