We bought this TV 3 months ago and don't regret it one bit.  It was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  We do not have satellite or cable (only reg. antenna) and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the "digital" signals.  Again, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to HD
