Your rebate submission has been received.
Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons:
REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINE
REQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04
***********************************************

There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase.
All were followed to the "T".

I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon.

Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole.

If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache.
Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand
