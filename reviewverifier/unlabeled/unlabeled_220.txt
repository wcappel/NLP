In general, I have realised that CF cards have a 1-2 years life. This is my 3rd CF card in 5 years, and my 2nd Sandisk card to-date. My first (also Sandisk) is still working, but its only 32MB so not very useful on long trips except as backup. With a 5 Megapixel Canon, this 512Mb card stores about 200 highest resolution images.  Have used this for only 3 months so far, but have noted that the Ultra II is definitely faster than others. Quality and life seems to be better than the Viking cards I have used, but time will have to tell how true that is
