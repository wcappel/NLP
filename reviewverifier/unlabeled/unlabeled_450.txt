This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again
