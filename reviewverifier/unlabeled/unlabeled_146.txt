I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters.  Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands.  Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use.  Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions.  Don't waste your money
