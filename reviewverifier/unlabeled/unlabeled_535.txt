bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room. the sound is clear and crisp. a lot better than a usual mini component. no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the trick.handy and easy to use. good quality sound for such a small piece. thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose. im a satisfied customer. so far i dont have problems. please dont let me have one
