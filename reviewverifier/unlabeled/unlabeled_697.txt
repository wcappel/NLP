Upon buying my notebook computer, I immediately purchased this mouse.  The touch pad on the laptop is sufficient for basic navigation, but for heavy use, especially web browsing, an external mouse is a must.  The mouse has an USB adapter that clips on the bottom of the mouse for convenient storage when not in use.  Mouse works fine even several feet away from laptop. The curved buttons that fit your fingers make using this mouse very comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this devise for greater laptop productivity & enjoyment.
