Just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers, I was searching for CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 
ADVANTAGES ARE: 
1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 
2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio. 
3) Fairly good sound for the money.
4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit).
DISADVANTAGES ARE:
1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design!
2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?). 
3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC!
4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use.
I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use.
Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months!
UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night
