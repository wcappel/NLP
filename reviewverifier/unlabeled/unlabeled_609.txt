I have purchased this DVD player to replace an older version of Sony DVD player that started to have problems playing DVDs (especially the scratched ones). Besides that I wanted to have a capability to play other formats (including photo discs, etc.). I think this was the right choice for the money. The DVD player handles every task as expected. Sony didn't disappoint
