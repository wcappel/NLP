I have used about half of these batterys. Mostly in clocks and different items around the house, but also I used them in the flash for my camera and they held up real good. 

I have a lot of rechargeable batterys, but these are better because they last a lot longer. Often the rechargeable batterys only last for a few months if that long. Alkaline batteries for me can last for up to a year and longer. 

If Amazon went back to free shipping on these then I would buy them up and give them to friends as a gift or a prize. I do not know what the shipping is, but it may still be worthwhile. I just know so far these batteries have held up real good and I would highly recommend them.
