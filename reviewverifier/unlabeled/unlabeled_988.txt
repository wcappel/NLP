First of all, let my point out that mine came with demos of crimson skies and mech assault and the full version of xbox classic arcade.  Mine was new in the certified microsoft box, etc.  Maybe they just updated the games.

Anyways, it is in my opinion a better deal to buy the 12-month pack, but I decided on the 3-month just because I've got the 2-month trial already and didn't want 14 months built up.

In the box:  There's the communicator headset, a 3-month subscription card, the game discs, and several manuals on connecting to xbox live.

The communicator:  Purely awesome.  I have read many people's comments saying that it breaks at the little clip.  I grant it that the clip is thin and could potentially break easily, but it is not uber fragile.  Don't be afraid to put it on.  The headset weighs next to nothing and is really comfortable.  It has great outgoing voice quality and great sound quality through the speaker.

Xbox Live Itself:  Do you have broadband?  Do you have a router and a switch or hub if needed?  If the answers are both yes, you need xbox live.  It is incredible.

Buy this or the 12-month kit if you are just starting (but don't forget to start your account first with the free 2 months.  After you have live already, renew with the subscription card
