Great remote, does evertying I hoped and dreamed. The only downside was the set-up. Logitech went to great lenths to make the set up as simple as possible - unfortunatly that made the fine tuning of the remote a long process navigating a large number of learning steps. In the end I am very happy with the product and would suggest it to anyone - just put aside some time to get it to work exactly how you wish
