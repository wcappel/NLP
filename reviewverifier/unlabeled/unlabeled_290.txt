The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit.

This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers.

You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit)
