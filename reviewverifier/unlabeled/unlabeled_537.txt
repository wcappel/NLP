Charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking. 

Charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest 15-minutes charger I used. but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly. 

The build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side. compare to the one I previously owned. 

Generally, well worth the money.  GOOD BUY!
