I have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all. I never installed any software for it, I simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since. It may lack the frills of a more expensive controller, but I am very pleased with its toughness. Until there is a game pad for the PC that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles, I'll stick with the durability feature instead
