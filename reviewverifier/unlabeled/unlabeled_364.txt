I'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuaI, and have owned several previous models of Wacom tablet. For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to "submarine" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room.
Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off! Too bad, it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it. Looks like my trusty workhorse Intuos2 tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service, if this is the level to which Wacom's legendary tech support has fallen.
