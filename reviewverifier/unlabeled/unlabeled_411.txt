I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator & Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it
