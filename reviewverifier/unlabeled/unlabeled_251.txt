I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet.  I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards.  I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology.  I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound.  I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card.  That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need.  The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear.  I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them.  I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself.

Amazing buy.  I cant say enough good things.  I dont speak geek about the improvements, its like art.. you know what you like, and I love this card
