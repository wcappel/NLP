My opinion will probably differ from other reviewers.

This strap works well IF you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera.

As to be expected, it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots.

Personally, I went back to the neck strap because, if using the hand strap, the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down. If you're out roaming around, the neck strap frees your hands up, reducing your fear of dropping the camera, eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and, with the neck strap, the camera is readily available.

I have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made.
