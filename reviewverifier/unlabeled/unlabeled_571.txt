I owned the Canon EOS 1-d, which I sold to obtain the &quot;latest-greatest&quot; EOS 1-d Mark II. My first model(1-d)came with this handstrap, and I found it to be VERY, VERY useful, and incrediby imporant me, being an action-sports photogropher-
 
 Imagine my dismay and anoyance at discovering that this item which was so useful and,(IMHO)absolutely necessary as my wonderful handstrap (WHICH WAS INCLUDED in the previous model)..... had been left out of the &quot;newer and so much improved&quot; version. 
 
 I've called and emailed Canon repeatedly(WHICH I STRONGLY SUGGEST ANY/EVERYONE DO)trying to bring attention to this issue, which, to me, is unexpected, and a completly unacceptable discrepancy. 
 Then consider the 30 plus dollars that Canon is TRYING to charge for it, and well here I go, off to my old fateful Amazon to GET ME ONE !! Actually, its from Adorama, and only about 20 bucks, instead.
 
 As for my review of the strap itself, if you haven't yet gathered; Considering the cameras weight, and me constantly running up and down dirt hills chasing motocross racers and the like, I found it literally, indespensible!
 Highly recomended !!
