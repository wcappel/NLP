This printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear.  I have a Cybershot T-1 camera and the combination is nice.  The printer speed was quick too! I couldn't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the TV and view the pictures that I had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control.  I would recommend this printer because of the easy setup, quick printing speed, and excellent quality of the pictures
