The tablet has been very helpful in my digital drawing classes and in my interior design business for quick sketching. It is user friendly, sturdily constructed and electronically dependable. I prefer the large screen format and this size is very adequate. If it should ever have to be replaced, I would purchase the same model. I highly recommend this particular tablet
