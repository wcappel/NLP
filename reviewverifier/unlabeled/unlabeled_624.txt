The hook up and downloading the software was very simple.  There was a error problem with the drivers.  My computer is fairly new with windows xp.  I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand.  Amazon is so great about handling returns.
