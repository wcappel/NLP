     One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running.  Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car.  

     I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic.  Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format.  If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice.  I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality.  

     The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition.  The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat.    

     Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them.  They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them
