For sub-$100, this little stereo does everything I need it to. This "micro" unit is truly small: it fits on top of our microwave, speakers and all. The CMT-NEZ30 replaced a boombox that conked out. To replace it, I wanted something through which I could play my MP3 player. That function works well. It is an simple auxiliary input, and allows me to play my podcasts at home without walking around with headphones on. 

At 30 watts, the sound is ample for the kitchen, and significantly more powerful than what I had previously. I didn't want something so powerful that needed to be played loudly in order to get full sound. That is not to say it can't put out some volume, however. As for sound quality, it is the very crisp, balanced sound that Sony fans have come to expect. For the wide range of music I play, the bass and treble settings cover it all. 

The single-CD player may discourage some people, but since it can play MP3 CDs, you can get some serious playtime out of it. For myself, my cooking is rarely so complicated that I can't stop to change a CD, anyhow. 

But I saved the best thing for last: it has a cassette player! (Insert cricket chirps here.) 

All in all, I am very happy with this unit for its versatility, size, and sound quality. It was the perfect solution for my needs
