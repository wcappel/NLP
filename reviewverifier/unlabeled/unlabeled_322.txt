This USB Flash Memory Drive works exactly as described, and I'm glad I bought it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use.  My laptop has two USB ports, one directly under the other.  This device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second USB device to the other port at the same time.  I've given up on the rebate.  It's been nearly 5 months, and follow-ups have not helped
