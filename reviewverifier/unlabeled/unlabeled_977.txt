I bought the original Tom Tom Go back in November 2004.  Since then, my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure.  My last attempt, 10 days ago, was an effort to buy updated maps for my product.  Yes, their website will offer to sell you maps, but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own, and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing, in some cases for a large sum of money.  If you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call, you will be disappointed.  I am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported
