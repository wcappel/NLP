I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great.  The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles.  However, it is just right for me.  I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate.

I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds.

The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension.  (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.)  What were they thinking?  Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous.  Don't they have a focus group review these things?
