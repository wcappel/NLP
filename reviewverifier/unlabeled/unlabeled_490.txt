I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one.  Some Dream System.  The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well.  After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas.  I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!!  And i haven't even watched a movie ye
