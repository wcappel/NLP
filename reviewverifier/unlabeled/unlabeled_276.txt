Very happy with the Nano.   It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly.   She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!

Good buy, good product, good amazon!
