I bought this and other sony headphones (noice cancelling).  I travel sometimes because my work and I prefer use the Fontopia headphones because they are small and the sound quality is good.  In addition, they isolate the outer noise enough good due to their design.

The small case is nice and protect them from scratches...

I recommend this product.
