The relatively inexpensive, well-designed Logitech Nascar wheel and pedals are ANALOG, a MUST for racing games like Need for Speed. Analog potentiometers slide along infinite voltage points between turn-left or right. The wheel suction cups hold snugly for a standard desktop. The pedals tend to slip slightly and may be at a slightly awkward angle, but can easily be mounted to a small, inexpensive piece of hardboard or plywood, or car floormat. You could also design a 1x2 wood slide-into-place framework. The twenty-dollar "Try Me" wheel I returned was DIGITAL (full turn-left or right), as ineffective as using keyboard arrow keys.
