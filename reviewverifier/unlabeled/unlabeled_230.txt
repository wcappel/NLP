First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J.
