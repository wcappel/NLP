First the good.
The feedback is strong and prescise. Very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game. NFS Most Wanted and GTR 2 are great with this wheel. The shifter is awesome, although you do not want to beat it up. A ginger approach makes it work best. The pedals are very solid with good tension, although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three. I use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal.
Now for the bad.
The clamping system works, but for how long? Plastic screws are only going to last so long, and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put. There are mounting nuts on the bottom, but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk? Microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion. The shifter works well, and I am sure it will last with care. Be nice to it though. The pedals are to close together. Other than that, they are perfect.
Overall, I highly recommend this wheel. For the money you can't get a better wheel
