Pros: Three customizable video profiles (movies, broadcast TV...); Excellent brightness and contrast; good viewing angles L & R of center; Generous input options;

Cons: Big, centered on/off button cries out for my toddler to turn it on/off/on/off. Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it.

The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player (&lt;$150); the visual results were simply outstanding.

Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables.

So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite). This is not a cheap endeavor
