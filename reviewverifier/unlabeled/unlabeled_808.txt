When I first got my Sony dvd burner I had numerous failure with burns. I tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem, big stacks of failed burns. When I called Sony to complain they suggested I use Verbatim. I did and in at least 150 burns I have no failures.  So naturally I'm hooked on Verbatim.  It must be the best
