I purchased this product for my 3 yr old.  He loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise.  It did not come with instructions, so we're having to self teach ourselves the features.  Surprisingly, I can't get the vibration feature to work with his Nascar game and this is a Nascar race wheel.  The vibration works for his SpongeBob game??
