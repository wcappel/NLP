My biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my Win98 (not SE) machine.  Ive only used it with Compact Flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine.  No install problems either, even though the machine/OS is pretty old.

The "pop down" door is a little goofy, but I just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing.  This props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out
