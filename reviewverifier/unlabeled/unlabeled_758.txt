the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would. it is by far the cheapest one i've ever found and i'll probably get another one soon.
FYI: i use the card in my nikon digital camera. with the pics set to 6 megapixals and using the uncompressed format(approx 1.8 meg ea.), i have 190 pics and 10 short 1 min movies and the card is about 80 percent full. 

that is awesome...........barny
