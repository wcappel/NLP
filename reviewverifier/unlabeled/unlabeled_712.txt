I bought this memory card for my Canon SD 200...after using it for approximately 3 months with no problems whatsoever, I took a video and the card just flat out broke.  First the screen said "Image not available" and then "memory card error".  I tried everything to fix it - but nothing worked.  I lost all the pictured I had stored on it, and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed...now I have a Panosonic one and I'm really happy with it.  My advice: splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand, and it'll be worth it
