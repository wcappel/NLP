We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area.

The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money.

I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it.
