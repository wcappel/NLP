I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works
