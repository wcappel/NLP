So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE.
It is a great item for the money.
