I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too.

The only minor issue I have is when I'm in "TV" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however.

Set up was extremely easy and a complete "no-brainer".

Great system for a great price
