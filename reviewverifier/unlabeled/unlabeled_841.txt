The previous reviews are similar to mine.  All one has to do is watch the Discovery HD Theater  and immediately they will realize what a great TV it is, but also the picture quality is sharp,color is beautiful and the TV is not 300 pounds in weight. I enjoy my 42" Samsung DLP HDTV WAY MORE than I ever realized possible
