The Logitech Z5500 speaker set is one of the best deals around... You get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder, true sourround sound and a digital control unit. Sound is fantastic- You may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media player/sound card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output.

The best part... It can play loud, too! Cranking it up to its full potential produces deep, rich pounding bass, without even making the amplifier's heat sink very hot to the touch!

A best buy!
