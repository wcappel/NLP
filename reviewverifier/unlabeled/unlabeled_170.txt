I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had.  I quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used RF and was able to control multiple AV systems in my house.

I have not done it yet, but I plan to buy the Lighting products so I can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night!!!   Very cool
