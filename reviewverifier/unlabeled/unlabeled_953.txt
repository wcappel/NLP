We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away.
