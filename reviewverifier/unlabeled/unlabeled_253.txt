       I have had the X-Fi Platinum for about one month.  I upgraded from Soundblaster 5.1, a big upgrade.  I have an Asus Motherboard, AMD processor and NVidia video and have not had any problems at all.  I got the card to record vinyl to CD.  I have about 500 albums.  The advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point.  
       I have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine.  The recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects.  I have put recordings from the records on my mp3 and burned cd's.  Better sound than a casette tape and I've just scratched the surface with the software features.  
       I have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it.  All I need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features.   The card is expensive but worth it, particularly if you have a specific use for it.  Take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available, you deserve it.
