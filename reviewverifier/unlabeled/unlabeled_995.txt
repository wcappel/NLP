 After reading reviews on this and other products, I decided to go with the Dual XDM-6820. I got it from Amazon for $79 and free shipping. I've been using it now for about a month and have not been disappointed by anything! (I was already expecting the ridiculously bright lights from the other reviews) This stereo has so far been one of those purchases that keeps surprising me with it's versatility and features. I've found that a quick perusal of the instructions was enough to be able to use almost all the important functions: CD playback, radio station presets, radio scan, eq customization, switching between albums on a single MP3 disc, mute, external audio source plugin jack (i.e. iPod or even a Walkman), etc.

The sound tends to be a little on the high and crisp end, and I have to turn the bass eq. up to 5 (out of I think 8) to get a decent frequency range. But it's not bad enough to take away from the overall value of this gem.

Overall I can't understand why this stereo was so cheap! It's way better than a Pioneer model I bought a number of years back. The 50x4watts have my little Chevy thumping and I love the MP3 features of being able to pop 8 albums on a single disc and quickly switch between them. This model is a gem, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a car MP3/CD player, but who wants to spend less than $100. Buy it
