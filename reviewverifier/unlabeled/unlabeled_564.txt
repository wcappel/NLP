I bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that! One day I plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn?t respond. It?s a XP sp2. 
I unplugged it and tried again with the same result, the same with the regular pc?s where I usually use this flash drive. Bottom line: money wasted. 
Being a regular costumer of sandisk, I must say im very dissapointed. The must frustating thing is that I wont get a refund because the 30 days expired. 
Besides, it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one (the 512 micro flash drive).
So, try some other product.
