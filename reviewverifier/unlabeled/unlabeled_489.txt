I started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment. A wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my TV. After searching for a while, there were only a couple options available: the Sony DAV-FX100W, a system by Panasonic that had an optional wireless option, and a wireless receiver kit made by Kenwood. After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking. Overall, I'm very happy with this system
