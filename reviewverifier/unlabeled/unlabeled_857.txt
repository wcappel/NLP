I purchased this item recently and it's excellent in all aspects. It took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually. The subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive. The centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth, but still it does a good job. Overall, I would say it's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance
