Works OK. The batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves. I don't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap. This is not an extremely "smart" charger (special wave cycle, etc.) but it works
