First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones
always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!
