I bought this player in December 2005,since then , this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well.
I have no complaint about it, because I'm extremely dependent of this player, so that means that i use it, around 5 hours in my days off,and  2 hours in a regular day.Another example of how durable  this player is, because I like to exercise(running) with the music as my main power��, therefore with the really hard to find function(anti-shock) in portable hard drives, the iaudio x5 is one the most functional PMP on the market.
About the sound is just incredible clear with the right earphones.the unique complaint is about the non-sync with WMP,so I'm still waiting the right firmware... 
 As a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products.
