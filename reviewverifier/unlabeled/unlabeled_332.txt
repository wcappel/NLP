I'd had quite a few previously viwed DVDs that had scratches.  As a result, my DVD player would freeze.  This product fixed a couple of DVDs for me.  As far as the haze, you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of Optrix afterwards.  I stopped buying DVDs new unless I can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin
