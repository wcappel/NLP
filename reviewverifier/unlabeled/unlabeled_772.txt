These batteries are far stable and durable in long term use. I have owned non-brand name and Kodak rechargeable batteries. They are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized life-span. Sometimes one in pair die out then other remains(Not SONY). I can't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply.

Those SONY batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained, the pair(2 batteries) go down together. 
It's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply, like digital camera
