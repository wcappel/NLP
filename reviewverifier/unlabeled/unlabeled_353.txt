You're money is better spent on another product.

It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made.  A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged.  I had one fan made a scraping noise.  

The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in.
