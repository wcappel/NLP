This system worked great for my 40 GB iPod. The carrying case and interchangable plug-ins are nifty for international travellers. A word of warning -- the 60 GB iPod Photo does not fit in the docking station. Altrec insisted that it does at the time I purchased it in July 2005. Be sure to order the "Altec IM3 for iPod and iPod Photo" that is now available if you have the Photo iPod.
