I live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with sub-woofer,plus reciever and dvd/cd player was just too much. True, the 3-2-1 doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems, but the size, ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock
