I too was looking for an iPod connection for my '99 9-3 Saab that was w/o original radio/cd. I couldn't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me, anyway it was fairly easy to install, took me an hour from start to finish. All I needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire stripper/crimping tool. I've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright. Great for daytime, way too much for night. I've considered a couple options, one was dark window tint overlays but I've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover. I'll slice the FP cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers, some velcro and I'll have a cover that will work at night, set the unit how i like and place the FP cover over it using the velcro to secure. Should be a breeze to do.

I owned a $350 Eclipse CD player and the Dual doesn't sound quite as good but the feature set, price and iPod connector make up for the slight difference in sound quality. The skip protection in the Dual seems better than the Eclipse.

All and all a great buy. I'm very happy with the Dual
