The other reviews I am reading about this clock do not do it justice.  I just opened it 20 minutes ago, and it's on my desk already synched with the Atomic Clock.  I am very impressed.  The green LED is awesome!  I own a lot of atomic clocks, and this is the first LED one I've seen besides the ... Sangean/Proton one.  This thing is solid, and it looks like it was made in the 60's or 70's when you had heavy, quality electronics in a tight package.  This is worth way more than the selling price
