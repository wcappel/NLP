I just received my printer tonight and could not wait to try it out. I have had a Sony digital camera for over two years, and have only been able to print pictures via my regular inkjet printer. I decided to purchase this photo printer so I could get much clearer, better quality pictures. I love that this printer allows you to print from a Memory Stick without having to connect the printer to your computer. It could not be easier. Just insert the memory stick in the printer and you are set to go. It was extremely easy to set up, and it comes with trial paper and ink. I have only used it to print out 6 pictures, but thus far I am very happy with my purchase. The photo's are extremely clear. They look like I took them to a high quality lab to have them developed
