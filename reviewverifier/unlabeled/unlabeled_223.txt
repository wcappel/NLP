I'm not beholden to the SanDisk brand, and did quite a bit of research, and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value. In fact, the "Ultra II" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product.  Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution.  Download is speedy, too.

I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason.  

Highly recommended
