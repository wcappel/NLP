as someone else mentioned its not the sturdiest rack out there, but it has not tipped over on me so i really cant complain.
it looks good, and its easily put together. 

as for the sturdy issue, i look at it like this. since when do you place cd racks in the middle of the room?? NEVER!! 
people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will NEVER have an issue with the rack at all. i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it, and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling. oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation. 
i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd's.

personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack
