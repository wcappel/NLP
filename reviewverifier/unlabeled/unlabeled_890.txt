I searched and hunted this monitor for the best price for months.  I first saw this monitor at Best Buy.  I was so impressed with the quality of the picture.  I was sold on "XBRITE", but I hesitated at the price of $399.00.  I watched the ads for months, checked other retail outlets, searched other online retailers, and went back to Best Buy on several occations to see this monitor, hoping I could catch this item as an "Open Box Item".
  
I am very happy with this monitor.  Set up was a breeze, connect, plug in, and go.  When I do buy a new PC with digital for monitors, this monitor is already able to switch.  The clarity is remarkable; I am using 1280 x 1024 resolution that fits this screen perfectly.  I can't add anymore to what other reviewers have already said about it stats.

As far as quality and service and price from Amazon.com, I give them 5 stars.  I have no complaints. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for quality
