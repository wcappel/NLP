This printer was very easy to use.  Just pop in the cartridge, paper, and plug in the camera.  The camera has to be a certain type of Canon, but there is an available computer cable (I have not gotten it yet), to hook up other cameras.  The benefit of using a Canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer, and still print out pictures.  These pictures look beautiful, and the colors are true and bright.  Printing couldn't be easier and fast.  I was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs, press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling.  It's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture.  Instant gratification
