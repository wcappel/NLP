I have tried a dozen holders; this is the best available.

Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc...

This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well.

In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk
