Verbatim is great. not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs.  I use Nero to perfectly complement the burning process. I was sceptic when i did geta great deal (~25 AR). heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line. 
Excellent discs would definitely go for em. was always a believer in Ritek Ridata before these. got to get some of those RWs.
