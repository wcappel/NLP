This usb hub is EXCELLENT!!  its small and compact, it actually communicates at usb 2.0 speeds, and the best part is that it doesn't need a separate power supply just to opperate.  This hub is designed to get all the power it needs from the usb port.  Overall this is the most well designed hub I've seen and with it having such a low price tag you can't go wrong
