I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology.  But there is a reason this item is discontinued.  It locks up when playing certain DVDs.  Sometimes after selecting "play movie" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.

Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say "Bad Disc" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing.  You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system.

Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know.  But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule
