I bought this product after reading several reviews here at Amazon. The setup to configure it to my cable system was a little tricky, but once we got passed that, it worked like a charm. I have only lost one recording on one of my DVDs. It's strange how that happened, since the dvd wasn't in the player at the time. But that was almost a year ago and it hasn't happened since then. This recorder is intuitive and simple to operate. The conversion from video to DVD is flawless, and the finalization process is easy to understand as well. I especially like how you can adjust the recording time. Mine's currently set to about four hours. I am totally blind and needed a product that was easy for me to operate without sighted assistance. This definitely fills the bill! if you're looking for a great product at a reasonable price, buy this one! you won't be disappointed! I've converted almost 50 videos and recorded several TV shows with this recorder! great buy
