Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year.  Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available.  I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great.  Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end.  

Adjusting brush size is the best.  Bracket keys never cut it for me.  I think the product does more, but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver.

If you do touch up work in Photoshop all day long, this is a must have
