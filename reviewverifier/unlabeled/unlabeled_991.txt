I liked the unit. it is very well built, materials and workmanship are close to perfect, sound quality is also very good. at least more than enough for a car.

Mp3 player is quite fast - it takes 2-3 seconds to recognize the disk.
"Random play" is not really random - the sequence is always the same and very predictable.

Controls are convinient, radio reception is also very good. 

The only issue which is VERY annoing - blue leds highhlighing push-buttons are EXTREMELY bright. there is no way to dim them or swith off. it's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on. I had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light:
