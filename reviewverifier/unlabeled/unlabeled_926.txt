Out of the carton -- everything worked as advertized, and the sound is pleasant. The speakers are the weak link. The day after I set it up to test it, I replaced the speakers with an inexpensive pair of Radioshack speakers I bought years ago: model 7s, I believe -- 4" woofer, 1/2" tweeter in a small, solid sealed enclosure of walnut veneer. These speakers are half the size of the supplied SONYs, and at least twice the weight.

The improvement in sound was astounding. It transformed this package, which has a robust amp, into something worth listening to for hours on end. It reproduced a wide range of music, from a Beethoven string quartet, to Louis Armstrong doing Fats Waller, to Renee' Fleming doing "Marietta's Lied" with full orchestra -- all with surprising authority. My only concern with the main unit is that the latch on the CD lid on top of the unit may one day wear out, preventing the lid from closing. The cassette player worked without any problems. I have yet to learn how to set the timer for the unit to turn on, but the instruction book is clear, and the remote is handy and easy to use.

I wonder how my main system, with Axiom Ti3s and a Klipsh subwoofer, would sound off this modest box from SONY -- or the old Jensen Tri-ettes I use in my 'study' system. Put a classic pair of JBL Lancers on this unit, and I don't think you would be the least bit dissappointed.

As I said, out of the carton the system works fine, and the sound is pleasant enough, but be aware that the electronics in the box are waiting to bloom. If you have an old pair of moderately efficient speakers in the basement or attic, dust them off, hook them up, and enjoy.
