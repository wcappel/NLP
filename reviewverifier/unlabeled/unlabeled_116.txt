Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase.

Also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar
