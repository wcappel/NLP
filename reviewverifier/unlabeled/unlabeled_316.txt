I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon.  It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic.  So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern
