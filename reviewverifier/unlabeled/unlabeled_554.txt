So much cheaper than buying a flash mp3 player... I've had this and other similar Sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem.  Have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data.  Transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos, but overall, a great buy, especially as it expands the capacity of my Treo 650 to five full length movies or twenty-four cds worth of music.  I only wish someone would make a  practical case that could hold multiple secure digital cards-they're so compact, I have to be careful not to misplace them.
