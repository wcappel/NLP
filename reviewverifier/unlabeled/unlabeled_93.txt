Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting.

I had a book holder from another company, but it was a piece of junk. It wouldn't hold up thicker books and the thin, rounded "holders" at the bottom kept popping off. I even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such.

It kept breaking and out of frustration, I went to an office supply store to look for another one. The silver Fellowes Book Holder was all they had. Although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy, I was skeptical. I had him go into the office, get me a thick, hardcover book--and proceeded to take the Book Holder out of the box to test it. (Yes, right there in the store!)

I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom. The plastic looks flimsy, but I'm tellin' ya, this baby really does well for holding open thick books! I've been using mine for about a week now and love it. No more headaches when I need to get a quote! YAY
