Bought this charger through Amazon when we lost the charger that came with our Canon Digital Rebel XT. This seemed like a good option at a good price and it has proven to be so. I actually prefer this to the Canon charger, which always felt like more of a travel charger to me. This one can sit on my desk and I don't have to get down on floor to get the battery. It also includes a car adapter and foreign power adapter - nice extras. To me this is the right charger to have around the house, even if you have the Canon charger (bring that one on your vacations since it packs up nice and small with the caveat that it's easy to forget in a hotel or something). Get an extra battery when you get this charger too so you can always have a charged up battery ready to go
