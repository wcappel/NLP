I agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty.  The on/off button is terrible.  It takes 5 tries to turn the unit off.  After 5 months of using this, the unit would no longer "talk" with the satellites.  I sent it back to DeLorme.  It tested bad.  Now I have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered.  Customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days!  The software claims it will compute driving routes for you...but it will crash your PDA instead.  I had to buy INav IGuidance software (which is outstanding) to get software that will actually compute road routes for me.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It has been a complete waste of money for me
