I've been using this system for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier with it. I bought it for my office so I could listen to my classical CDs while I was working on my website and writing book reviews. Plus, even though it only has a short external antenna, I can get the NPR classical music station on FM which is over a hundred miles away.

It's small enough to fit on my bookshelf and has great sound for the size of its speakers. Of course, it doesn't compare to my big stereo in the living room with its 4' high tower speakers, but who cares. It delivers most of the sound I need in a small space for background music.

All in all, well worth the money so far. Highly recommended at this point
