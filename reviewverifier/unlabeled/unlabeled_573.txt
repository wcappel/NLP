The clock itself works well. It did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect (we set a backup alarm the first night). The idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea, but why would Scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio?  Doesn't make sense to me.  Granted, I live in a rural area, but I am able to receive both AM and FM stations from as far away as Fresno, some 50 miles away, on other radios in the house (including a small portable, battery-operated one), and we do have a local FM station.  The tuner is so sensitive that I had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station.  I am unable to receive one static-free AM station, and I eventually, very gingerly, dialed in two fairly clear FM stations (one Spanish-speaking from Fresno, one local), but neither stay tuned in overnight..by morning when the alarm goes off, nothing but static.  A strange thing though...once, while trying to locate a station, I received a fairly clear one from SALT LAKE CITY....wow!  I plan to return the product
