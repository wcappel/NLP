  Im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item! I got this for christmas from my dad. I believe he bought it at best buy. Ive had it for almost ten months and I havent had any problems; it still plays the ipod, the clock still works, the date still works, and everything else still works. You dont even need to change the time; theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time. I dont know why people are complaining about that and the light; the light isnt THAT bright. If I encounter problems I will write another review but so far everything is perfect
