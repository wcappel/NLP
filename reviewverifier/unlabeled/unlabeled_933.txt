If you're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere. If you're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer, not this one. If you need a nice little stereo to play one CD at a time, space saving, full and clean tone - this is awesome !!! It looks really sharp, has a crisp sound. Perfect for a small bedroom or office. I am very happy with this purchase. Has a tape deck as well and radio. EQ settings are simple - no presets, just bass and treble - there is also DSGX switch [kind of like a loudness setting] just leave it ON. Very simple, well made - I like it !! No frills, great price
