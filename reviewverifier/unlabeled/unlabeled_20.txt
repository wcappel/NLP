Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more
