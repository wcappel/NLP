I originally bought this for my 20D with the BG-E2 batterygrip and when it arrived found that no instructions on how to safely attach it were included. After a bit of googeling I found those (in the MKIIN manual downloadable from Canons web site) and it felt pretty secure. It certainly helps when you are using larger lenses and its good value for the money. I have now upgraded to a MKIIN and have moved the strap to that body. If you find it hard to use the main dial you have probably tightened the strap too much
