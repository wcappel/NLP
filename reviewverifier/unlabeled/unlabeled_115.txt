I used this CF card with my Canon Rebel XT. Write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting. But this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology. If your camera doesn't support this technology then its of no use. It comes close to USB 2.0 transfer rates.

February 15th Update, finally this card failed. After formating the card will work for 15-20 snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error. Any amount of formating didn't correct the problem. Finally i have to dump it and now i am using one 1GB Sandisk Extreme III and another 2GB Sandisk Ultra II card. Both are working fine even after some bad handling
