I purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at Circuit City without first looking at the price. I was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax. I purchased the same sleeves at Walmart later the same day for 2.99. Ciruit City has great prices on many things (particularly electronics) but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced. (Same is true of many items at Office Max). I am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves (when purchased from Walmart or a simlar discounter at least) and they get the job done. These sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the open-ended sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in. These sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected
