I bought two of these wheels last month and I'm about to order 2 more (I'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally). I played Midnight Run II (windows) with these wheels and didn't experience the force feedback either. However, when I played NASCAR 3 with these wheels, then I got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight, but nothing when bumping the wall or another car. The force feedback amounts to a 'humming' vibration and is actually annoying. btw - there's an option in NASCAR 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work. The force feedback was just a 'nice' feature for me, but I really got it for the USB connection and table top design. I have a couple of the Interact V3 racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs' design is awkward to deal with and it's too tall to effectively use them on a table. But the LogiTech wheels work great on a table top! The LogiTech connectors are a little more reliable too. The pin connector housing on the V3 snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels. However, I do prefer V3's full size pedals to the LogiTech smaller pedals... but it's satisfactory
