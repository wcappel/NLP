I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it.  It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject!  Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose.  That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it.  Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)!  They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work.   There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else!  Any recommendations?  Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them.  I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty
