I used this reader for a week before it stopped working. It worked OK for the week that it worked at all. It would not read xD cards though. It did not detect that a card was inserted at all. I tried inserting the card fully, partially and even tried jiggling it a little. It seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted. It did, however, work with my compact flash card. Then, inexplicably, it stopped functioning entirely. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in Device Manager but the card was dead. I tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all.  Lexar support left a lot to be desired. I explained the problem in detail and the response I got was a generic "Try restarting the computer, etc, etc." Then, they wanted me to pay for shipping to RMA their defective merchandise. I sent it back to Amazon instead and got my money back. I'm willing to assume that I just got a lemon, but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a  refund rather than a replacement.
