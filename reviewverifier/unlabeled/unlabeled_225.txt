After reading reviews on every brand sold at Amazon I picked Pioneer since it was about the only brand that didn't have any complaints. I have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent. It uses DVD- disks only but since I never have used DVD+ disks that option is irrevelent to me.
