This card is not too fast but good enough for my camera... Well that means nothing to me, I don't have your camera and I could buy it for other things. There are 65 Reviews as I'm writing this, and nobody has contributed speed tests, not even estimates! The ones that don't mention speed at all might not care, but those who do should at least give approximate read/write timings. 

The easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your high-speed card reader (not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed). Then select a bunch of image files or any other files (at least couple of hundred MB worth of files) and copy them to the card. Time this. Divide the total MB amount by the time (in seconds). And you will get approximate information of this card's Write time! Do the opposite to test the Read time. This won't be 100% exact, but if at least 2 or 3 people do this, we'll get a pretty good idea of the card's Speed capabilities
