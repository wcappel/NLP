I'd say the main strength of this player is it's easy to memorize, easily accessible buttons. By the end of the first day I was able to perform all of the player's features without taking it out of my pocket. That being said, the only complaint I have is that the equalizer isn't that effective, although this could also be a feature of the headphones too. They fit comfortably (the headphones) but the sound quality is only so-so. There's really not that much bass, but then what can you expect fron earbuds? Nevertheless, I'd definately recommend this player to anyone tempted to join the wonderful world of portable mp3 bliss.
