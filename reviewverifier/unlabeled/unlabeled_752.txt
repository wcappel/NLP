I purchased this card for a Canon A95 digital camera, primarily because Canon sells this card at their website and because I read somewhere that SimpleTech makes the cards that come with (some?) Canon digital cameras. 

You can read about the card's specifications elsewhere, just let me say that this is my second SimpleTech card (I also have a 256 MB SD card that I use in a HP 49G+ calculator), and both cards work as well as advertised.  I will definitely buy from SimpleTech again.
