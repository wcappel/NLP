When I saw this component stereo system in a "Good Guys" store I was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing. As I started toying with the floor model, I realized how versatile it was, and decided that it was something I wanted to own. Sadly, the floor model was the only unit left in the store, and there wouldn't be anymore coming since "Good Guys" was going out of business. That was not acceptable to me. So, I went elsewhere to find the same system.

When I found the item on-line, for a much better price, I was sold. 
Getting it only took a few days, and it was delivered right to my place of work, for my convienence. 

What impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced. When playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects, the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound.

Other features were also pretty cool to me, such as the LCD light. While it gave off a nice blue glow, it could be dimmed, which was a nice touch. 

All in all, with all the features this device has, I am certain I will have many years of enjoyment. It is a great system for the right price and truly impressive
