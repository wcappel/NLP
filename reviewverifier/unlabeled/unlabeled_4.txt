I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage.
