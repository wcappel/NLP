I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive. 
I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver.
