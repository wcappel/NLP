Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out  how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 player
