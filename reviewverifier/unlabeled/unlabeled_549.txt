Ok, if you have two monitors side by side, or a single wide-screen format, this is the way to go!  I use this tablet with the Mac G5, with full functionality, and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen.  I have used the smaller tablets from Wacom, and they work very well, but this particular product is designed and constructed VERY WELL and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use!

Having the assignable "ExpressKeys" left and or right is really slick for repetitive
tasks.  

This model stands 5/8" high/thick, 10 and 7/8" deep (front to back), and just under 16 and 1/2" wide.  Take two late model white Mac keyboards and set them one behind the other, and that is about the footprint this item covers, (width and depth).  
So, you will need some desk space, or I have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen.  Quite comfortable!  

In any scenario, this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use.  

Thanks Wacom
