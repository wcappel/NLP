I just finished a 25 package of the Memorex 4.7GB 4x DVD +R Media and have reordered a 50 pack and 25 pack. All my DVD burns were successful. I am using a Sony DVD drive and have been burning my home video creations at 4x with MYDVD software that came with the drive. I have a Kenwood DVD player downstairs and a Sony DVD player upstairs. It plays on both, plus I have made copies for friends with all positive feedback. I highly recommend these discs.
