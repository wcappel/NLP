Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for "more than 3 weeks." I hope they will replace my unit with something that works
