If you own a Canon camera, Canon does NOT support WA (Write Acceleration) feature of Lexar's high-speed cards:

Current camera partners supporting Write Acceleration Technology: 

-Kodak Professional 
-Nikon 
-Sanyo 
-Sigma 
-Pentax 
-Olympus 

Other than that, this is a FAST card, if your camera supports WA, otherwise, it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra $$$?  Look up your camera on the link before you buy
