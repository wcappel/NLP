Bought this to free up my DVR - turn recorded movies into DVD's etc.  It works pretty well, accurate capture, easy to use.  Not crazy about the Software that's included.  Capwiz is OK, but limited, Ulead Video studio is clunky and sometime awkward to use, although between the two you can do just abou anything you need to.  It works BEST, if you record the HD version of shows.  Even if you don't have an HD TV, the converted image is much better
