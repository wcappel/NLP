There's a review here where someone takes their COMPUTER and analyzes the performance of the card.  Unfortunately, most of the time what matters is how the card works with your CAMERA.  A camera generally doesn't move data as fast as a computer, and it has to process it first - so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images (or other files) to your hard drive.  If that matters to you, great.

For the rest of you, especially camera users, here's the real story:
- You need a faster than standard card if you plan to use 30fps 640x480 video.  It's also a good idea with high resolution cameras, if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images.
- But ... I just bought a different 512MB SD card for $10 after rebate.  It's hard to beat that price / performance ratio if you're just storing photographs.  Sure, video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year, but other than that, regular speed cards work fine for many uses.

Always buy what's right for your needs.  And, if the price differences are small, go with the faster card.  

There are promotions every week on various memory cards, look for one if you have time.  Those can make higher speed cards a good value, though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well
