this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers.  But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews.  i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these, but they do lack base and loudness.  but overall i am pretty satisfied with these...
