I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar
