Like the other reviewer, I also have a NEC dvd drive. 

I've tried Sony, Memorex, Verbatim, Maxell, and TDX discs but none compare to Fuji. I've also tried generic ones but was 
p-o'ed every time I got another unintended frisbee. 
One brand in particular, mentioned earlier, would not "hold" what I wrote on the disc. On the first day, the disc was fine, go back to it in a month, the data is gone! The others would burn fine but more times than not, the quality of the picture would be downgraded, the video skiped, jumps, etc. And yes, I thought so too but nope, it happened on more than 5 dvds I tested.

Thank goodness I found these at the store -- on sale! What the heck, I'll give it a try. Can't get much worse. I gotta say, Fuji is all I use now. I haven't even gotten 1 coaster and I'm on my 4th 100 pack! I archive movie and picture files and the picture quality is as good as the first day. 

I highly recommend these! Spend a little more and get the quality and longevity you'd expect from writing on your dvds. Don't risk seeing your data one day, gone the next.
