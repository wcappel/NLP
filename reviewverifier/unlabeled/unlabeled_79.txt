I got this for my baby's room.  I was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews, but it's quite good (though I don't have the ear of an audiophile).  The bass is pretty powerful & the treble is good as well.  There is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well.

The room is about 10'x11' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room.

MP3 cd's appear to work effectively.  Panasonic has generally had good MP3 cd support (subdirectories are supported).

I'm very pleased
