I ordered the SimpleTech 1GB CF for my Canon Digital Rebel XT because the price was great and because I had read that SimpleTech made Canon-labeled cards. 

Two weeks after placing my order, with no word from SimpleTech and no tracking number, I contacted SimpleTech via the Amazon website. I got a very prompt response explaining that they never received the order from Amazon (some technical glitch) but to make it up to me, they would refund my shipping charges and send the card overnight.

The card arrived as promised. I put it in my camera and... nothing. I put it in a card reader and got an error. I contacted SimpleTech tech support through their website and got a very prompt response saying that the card was dead and they would gladly replace it. They sent me a UPS shipping label for the return and a few days later I had a new card.

The new card works perfectly and, although the fates conspired against me, I would definitely recommend SimpleTech to anyone looking for an affordable, top-notch product. Their customer service was extremely quick in responding and they replaced the defective card quickly and without hassle
