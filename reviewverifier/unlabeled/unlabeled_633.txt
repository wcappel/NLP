... That said, I'm very happy with this printer. Other reviews, like the one on C|Net, have faulted the printer for mediocre text printing. I can't really address that complaint...have a laser printer for text and only use the S830 for printing photos and I'm very, very happy with how it performs that function. It's fast, I like being able to replace the ink cartridges separately, supports Exif if your digital camera outputs the encrypted data and the pictures are indistinguishable from those printed conventionally. It's the perfect color printer for my advanced amateur needs
