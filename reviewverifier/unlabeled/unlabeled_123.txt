I have a 4300 square foot home.  I have purchased Novi wireless intercoms in the past and need to add to them.  One has been in the room above the garage, one in the kitchen, and one in the basement near the computers.  Those locations are not on the same circuit. I have never had any trouble getting them to work -- I've just had a couple wear out.  In fact, at our old house, we could pick up communications from our neighbors across the street who had a set and we finally each decided which channel we'd use so we didn't hear each other's conversations!  You might want to remember that when you use them!  Clearly our neighbors intercoms weren't on the same circuit -- they weren't even in the same house!  Maybe the newer ones (mine are at least six years old, but they are Novi wireless intercoms that you plug into the wall) have changed, but I've never had a problem like the one described.  Maybe it's peculiar to the Westinghouse brand
