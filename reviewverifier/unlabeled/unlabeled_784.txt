Order this to try and save on money since I didnt need a whole lot of outlets, I pluged my computer to it and TV. On a full battery It was able to run for about 5-10mins with my 32' CRT tv and 19' LCD monitor + comp. Good enough for me to power down the computer, would last longer if the TV was off im sure
