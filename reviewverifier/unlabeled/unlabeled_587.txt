A good add on to ipod compared to other costly or cheap products. The sound is good. It is loud enought to fill a medium hall with music. The wake-up and sleep funtions are good. The buttons are not smooth kind of make tik-tik noise. I wish we could forward and skip songs from the base. You can dimmer the back-Light if not needed. Recommend it
