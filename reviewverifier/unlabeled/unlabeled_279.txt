I own many Lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance. However, I must add that LEXAR (USA) provides EXCELLENT service.   I live in Cape Town, South Africa..... whilst I was formatting one of my LEXAR cards in my Nikon D70, I terminated the formatting halfway (accidentally).... card was damaged.....  sent card to LEXAR USA after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days I had a brand new card couried to me by LEXAR..... no questions asked.... This is outstanding service!!!  Well done Lexar.....Exceeded expectations
