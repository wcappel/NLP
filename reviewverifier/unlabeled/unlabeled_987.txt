Received notice last week that it was in the shipping stage.  It still is.

Shows in-stock, but it's not actually shipping (thought he page says it is).

Contacted Amazon, and they say it's shipping on the 15th, but the page still says in-stock and available for shipping.

I have no idea what's going on here...  They were not at all clear.  Did they over-book
