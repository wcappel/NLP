This printer produces 4X6 prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab.  The quality is fantastic, and the relatives were in awe.

It uses dye sublimation, a completely different printing process.  The result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard, not a piece of paper.  You don't put ink in it, so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer.  You buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from Canon.  (KP-36IP, for example
