Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy.
