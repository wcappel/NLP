Having the Wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures.  It is the best investment I have made lately in my business.  It saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other over-use/strain problems related with high mouse useage.  I can be much more precise on my work in photoshop! I would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers "must have list"
