First off, not a perfect product far from infact, takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions arn't really clear. I had the Audigy 2 ZS before this sound card and it was a simple install card, install drivers and your good to go; huge improvement over the onboard AC97. This was the first problem, the fact that I had drivers on my system from a previous Sound Blaster card, had to sweep them from my system. my next problem was that the X-Fi drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards, but nothing that updates from there website won't fix (the original drivers must be installed first). Now why would I give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5, the sound is incredible. If the Audigy was step up from the onboard, then the X-Fi is a giant leap. Great for games and movies
