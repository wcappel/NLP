I purchased the Lexar 1GB 80x Pro CF card for use with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 8 mega pixel DSLR camera. I also have a SanDisk 1GB CF card which I also use with the DSLR. Of the two cards the Lexar is far and away the fastest in recording & reading, I can take multiple shots at the camera's highest resolution (8 Mega Pixels)yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more. There are also no compatibility problems.

To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar.

I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future
