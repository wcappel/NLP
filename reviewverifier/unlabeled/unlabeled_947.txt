First of all, let me say that I LOVE this stereo.  Have had it for a year or two.  I don't think you can do any better with this price range, and more. I highly recommend it. 

I have a question - does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd's of all regions?  I tried to write JVC an email but didn't get any response.  

Hopefully somebody has the answer!

Thanks
