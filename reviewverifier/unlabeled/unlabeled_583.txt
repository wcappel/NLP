I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer
