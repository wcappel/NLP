If you have basic PC skills this remote is for you.  With its USB connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it. The small LCD screen is very easy to set up and you. If your to lazy to customize your remote(me), it also has a learning port.  The learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one.  My favorite feature is turning everything on.  The button "Play DVD" turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv, additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres tv/video.  The only problem that I have with this remote is the recharge base.  It sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed on/off and gives off a beep.  All in all this is probably the best remote ive  ever had
