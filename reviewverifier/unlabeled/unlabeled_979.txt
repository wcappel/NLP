I've been driving a Logitech Momo (black) for about 3 years, and loved it. Until now.

This new wheel, pedal, and gearshift set is, in a word, awesome.

With 900 degree wheel rotation, stronger force feedback, a clutch, and gated shifting the level of realism is unbelievable.

Did you ever want to go racing, but couldn't afford the time or cost? With this set and Live For Speed, GTR2, rFactor or (one of these days?) iRacing's as yet unreleased programs you can. And after some practice "in the privacy of your own home," you can go online and race LIVE with folks all over the world. You heart WILL pound and you WILL sweat!

Okay, maybe I'm weird, but at 60+ I still manage to find time to race 10-15 hours a week! And there are no long, tiring drives to the race track, no hotel and food expenses, no long waits for the other classes to get off the track, and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you. An hour behind the wheel is an hour racing.

I have a heart valve problem and there are times I wonder if this is really safe after all
