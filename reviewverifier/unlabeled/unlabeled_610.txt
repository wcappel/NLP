The device works perfectly.  The picture quality is excellent, the documentation is adequate, and the overall robustness of the machine seems good.  Loading is slower than my old DVD player - a Toshiba.  I really like the way I can watch one DVD part way through, replace it with another, and have the player still remember my place in the other one.  I also appreciate the HDMI interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet.  In the end, I was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far, that's what I got
