I bought this card reader to use with my SD memory cards from my digital camera and Palm Tungsten E2. Transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and Palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables?  This little device allows me to add, delete, copy and paste files using My Computer.  It takes up virtually no room, and I use it between both my desktop and laptop computers.  There was no installation issues - I have Windows XP on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately, without any interference from me. Last but not least, the price can't be beat
