First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw.

batteries...
A. it eats them up ...FAST
B. if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with, it wont go as loud, and if it thinks your playing it to loud, it will start..skipping.. or something of the sort.

But, it has good sound quality, and honeslty when your on the go, when do you really need it blasting?

Also they are just..barley large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly, but it doesnt weigh much at all. 
And i really like how if i ever say..lost my Ipod somehow, it has a Cd player (walkman) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod.
 ( the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters )
