Installation was easy.  With the correct harness and knowing your speaker config, it took about 1 hour.  BTW, I have never install a car stereo before.  

It has all the features you can think of from a mp3 player.  Many small details, like able to save preset volume and prefered EQ and seperate them in FM mode or CD mode.  I am really impressed.  Build in 200 Watts AMP creates a solid and deep sound with my factory speakers.  Of course, with a speaker upgrade and preamp it will sound alot better, but this is really pretty good with no other modifications.

The i-plug is a blessing.  Ever tried to play your MP3s with a FM modulator or tape adaptor?  They gernerally sound really distorted and at high volume the treble will crack.  The iPlug is a simple 3.5mm plug that can plug into anything from the ubiquitous iPods to the cheap MP3 players you buy from Wal-Mart.  The sound is always solid with no distortion and you can tap into the EQ and build-in amp to adjust the sound.

The bottom line is ~ you really can not beat the price and quality of this inexpensive cd mp3 head unit.  I have no idea about the durability, but I am really happy about it at the momen
