Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on "Bass" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds.
