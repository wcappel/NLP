I love this controller.  I have small hands for an adult, and the pad fits me well.  I like the shape better than even the now-standard Controller S shape.  I have no problems with delay or drift.  I haven't used the D-pad, but the thumbsticks and buttons work great, though I'm not a terribly heavy user.  This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own.  My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands.  I like the feel of the plastic.  The only thing I would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top, though I've never had a problem with grip
