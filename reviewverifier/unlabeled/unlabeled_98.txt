I wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different PCs.  The first, a Dell M50 Precision laptop with 1 GB memory and a 1.8 GHz processor, would capture sound just fine, but only color haze for video.  I thought that it was because the M50 has underpowered USB 1.1 ports, so I wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop (also 1GB memory).  The best that I got was audio with the sound speeded up (voices sounded like they were on helium) and the same color haze for video.  Apparently, it doesn't pay to scrimp in this area.  I will promptly return the product and look for something better. From the other reviews, it doesn't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent
