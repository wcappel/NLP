Recieved in 2 days, paid $116.99. Slim, lightwieght. Takes a little time to load but produces a really nice picture.  Hooked up to my Yamaha RX-V1600 reciever and then on to a Samsung LN-S4692D LCD HDTV, both via HDMI. Looks to be a quality DVD player with nice finish and again a really nice picture. Watched The Incredibles and Madagascar with the kids and everyone was really impressed. Would definitely recommend.

Also played DVD-R's on this player, no problems
