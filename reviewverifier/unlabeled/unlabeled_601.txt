and I'm still happy! We initially had to get used to the software and the printer setup and yes, you do need some patience during the learning curve of this creative process - it's not the normal daily routine of most people.  We never encountered any errors when creating the actual labels or printing them.  We also have not had any problems upon using the labelled CDs or DVDs.  We're happy with the product
