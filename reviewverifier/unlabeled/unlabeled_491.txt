I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet.  It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well.  It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV.  
The sound quality is just fine for movies and TV programs but fair at best for listening to music on CD's or from the FM tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo.  The base is not tight and kind of whoompy, although there is plenty of it.  I actually had to decrease it by 3 db.  The many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the "sport" which does sound like being in a stadium.  Most of the time it is best in "auto" performing in the method the audio was recorded.  
The IR transmitter/receiver works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as AC power for the amp, a wire from the IR receive to the amp, and wires from the amp to both rear speakers.  Not as clean as one might imagine from the product description.  
As mentioned in previous reviews, the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack.  A 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with DVD's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple CD's to listen for music.  I certainly would prefer my stereo for that!
Over all I am satisfied with it and recommend it.  It performs well for what it was intended, to reproduce sound from movies and TV.  Again it is a good looking system.
