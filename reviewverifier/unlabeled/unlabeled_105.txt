The DVD Express 2.0 worked the first time I tried it. It always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have. I agree that Ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit. If you are having trouble getting this little baby going I would suggest a computer class would be apropriate.
