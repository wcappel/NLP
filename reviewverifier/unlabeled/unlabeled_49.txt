I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk
