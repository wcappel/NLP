I bought a 1GB with my new camera because I was giving my other camera and it's 256 memory card to my sister.  The smaller card would fill quickly and I'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them.  I paid about $9.00 more for my card in Sept., and thought that was a deal.  Now, you can get this card for $20.00.  That's a steal for a 1 GB.  also, I like the little case provided to keep the card safe when I take it to the store to develope the pictures.  Love it
