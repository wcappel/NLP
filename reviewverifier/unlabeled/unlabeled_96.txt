Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another.  Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway??  This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in. 

In truth I have two of these pretty good book things
