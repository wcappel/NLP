Received the TOMTOM 300 before date promised in perfect condition even though the box was dented. ( Good packing! )

I have used the TOMTOM to go from NYC to Monticello, NY and from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and home to NYC again. The TOMTOM performed flawlessly in Philly guiding me to the sites I wanted to visit and back to my hotel. I also tested it on routes I knew to see how it would route me if I deviated and it came through with flying colors.

The only shortcoming is that the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine. The on-board voice makes up for that letting you know when a turn is coming up. I have a co-worker who has used this device for two years and is very satisfied. I bought it on his recommendation and do not have any regrets
