I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended
