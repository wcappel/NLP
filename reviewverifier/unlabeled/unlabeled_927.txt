Not a bad little unit...  wish it remembered where you were on the CD when you turn it off like other units I'm used to especially since it doesn't really "shut off" but goes into "stand-by" mode...  Not as much power as I thought it would have for 30 watts...   Would be nice if the aux (ipod/mp3) jack was on the front not the back...  speaker 2 output would be nice...  simple little unit, works fine so far..
