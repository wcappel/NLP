I am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in Oaxaca.  I brought this speaker set to Mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky Panasonic cassette transcriber.  It worked like a dream.  Instead of using cassettes for transcription we used mp3s recorded on an Edirol digital recorder.  Instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these Altec Lansing speakers.  The sound quality was perfect for transcription, and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber.  In my down time I got to listen to music.  Can't beat that
