I was trying to find a small unit for the bedroom to replace a previous unit. The NEZ30 model (30 watts, not the NEZ3) fits the bill. The sound is incredible and loud for a small unit. It sounds better than the bigger unit I had. The design of the speakers with the special bass produces a very rich and round sound. And that's without the DSG activated. The bass and treble can be adjusted (-3 to +3) but only with the remote. If you buy a unit used be sure it has the remote. Also I needed something with a tape player like another reviewer
