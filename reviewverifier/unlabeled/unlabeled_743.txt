I will make this review very simple.  No matter what features you find attractive about this remote, its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable.  Unless you have large hands, you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it. (make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it)

In terms of features, the remote has only the simplest of "learning" features.  If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for.... good luck
