These are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds. Can't say anything else about them - except this - I noticed when I opened the box they came in 'my' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band. It did not really affect them adversely, but just be aware that yours may come this way also
