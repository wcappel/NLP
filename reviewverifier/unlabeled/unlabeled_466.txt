I searched far and wide and compared many tv's.  It came down to the Panasonic Plasma TV vs. the Sony KDFE42A10.  I went with the Sony due to price; but I'm glad I did.  I can't see putting [...]in a TV.  I am really pleased with the Sony; particularly the price I paid.  It was so much cheaper here at Amazon.com than at the big box retail stores
