I bought this card about 6 months ago when I received a Nikon Coolpix 5700 as a gift. I have to say, this card has never let me down. It writes images like there's no tomorrow, and it hasn't failed me once. I haven't lost a single image, and I don't plan on it while using this card. SanDisk has done it once again.
Buy from Amazon, I paid $20 more @ Staples for it
