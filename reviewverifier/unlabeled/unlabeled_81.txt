The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality
