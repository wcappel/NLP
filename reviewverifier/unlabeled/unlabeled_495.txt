This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room.  Assembly takes about two minutes.  The instructions are very clear.  The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?

It skips.  Like nobody's business.  At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.

So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.
