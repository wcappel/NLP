The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.

The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.

It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket
