 Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment
