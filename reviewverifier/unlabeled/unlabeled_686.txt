I've used Viking CompactFlash cards in digital cameras for years and have *NEVER* had a problem with *ANY* of them.  Never a glitch; every bit has always come through perfectly (and I did have a glitch with a CF card of leading brand "S...").  I do not own this particular Viking card, but I've owned 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB Viking CF cards and used them in 3 different (Canon) cameras.  As far as I know, this 2GB CF cards uses the same technology as at least the 1GB card I use all the time.

All that said, standard Viking CF cards are "8x" write speed (about 1.2MB/s write speed).  That is slower than many other CF cards. That may be an issue for point-and-shoot digicams with limited image buffers, but I've never found that to be a problem in digital SLRs with large write buffers -- the camera continues to shoot more photos while the Viking card finishes writing to the CF card.  For the price, the Vikings have been "winners" in my book.

A previous reviewer commented about difficulties with Viking Customer Service -- I have to wonder what the problem was that he experienced with the *product* that let him to call Viking's Customer Service in the first place?  Was it anything serious, or did he just have a question?  He never said.
(Not that the Cust Svc comments he quoted are excusable, if true; but they're so outrageous that they're a little hard to believe)
