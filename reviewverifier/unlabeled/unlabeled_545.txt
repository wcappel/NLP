I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use it
almost every day so far so good, I don't expect to have any problems with it.
I used to have a small wacom graphire and I used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now I own a new one 
the only advice I can give to you is to keep it clean, wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth
