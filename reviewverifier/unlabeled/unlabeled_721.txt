Lowepro offers consistently well-made products, and this SlipLock Pouch is no exception.  It is secure and well padded. I use it to hold a Garmin GPS60CS GPS receiver, but you could easily use it for a small digital camera or other accessory.  It is a bit deep for the smallest cameras, which might tend to get lost in the bottom of the pouch, although you could put additional items like spare batteries underneath to raise them up.  The main pouch has a double-closure design for good security: a drawstring closure is covered by the main flap with a velcro seal.  A front mesh pocket is a good place to store small things like spare AA batteries or, in my case, an external antenna for the GPS.  A cleverly designed double-velcro sealed belt loop allows you to easily and securely attach the pouch to your belt or the hip-belt of a backpack without having to remove your belt. Two D-rings on the sides also give you the options of using it with a shoulder strap.

NOTE (5/3/06): The photo of this pouch has recently been changed and no longer looks like the pouch I reviewed.  I don't know whether it is an error in the photo or whether Amazon has used the same description for a completely unrelated product.

NOTE  (5/27/06):  Correct photo has been added again
