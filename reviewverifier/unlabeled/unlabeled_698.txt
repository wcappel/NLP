a great mouse! perfect size, nice features. Simply plug it in and it starts working! Seems to be well made. To install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard. Then the casing top pops off.

however, for some reason, at least on my hp laptop- when this is plugged in the screensaver will not come on if left there. I need to unplug it if I'm gonna be gone for awhile.

I love this winter blue color, I'm so glad that I chose it. I have only had this for a couple months, but it works fantastically. I just hope it lasts as long for me as some of the other reviewers have said it lasted for them
