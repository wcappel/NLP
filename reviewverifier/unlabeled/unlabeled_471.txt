Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it.  I ordered it on June 15, and it was promised, by Amazon direct, not another seller via Amazon, between June 21 and June 23.  So I'm sitting here on July 15 with no TV.......
It really isn't Amazon's fault, it's the shipper, Eagle.  But whatever, I'm less than satisfied with this Amazon.com transaction.  I have seen the TV in stores and it looks good though..................
