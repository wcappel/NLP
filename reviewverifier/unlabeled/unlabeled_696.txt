Mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold antenna.Mine would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top. The idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off. This being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used
