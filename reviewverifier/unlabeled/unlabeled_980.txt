I've had a few wheels before, but finally Logitech came out with a wheel thats simulation grade.  The 6 speed shifter works great, and as for the clutch, I've found that there are plenty of games that support it, including GTR2 and Need for Speed Carbon thats just coming out.  Besides the lengthy setup and steep price, this is a great wheel for a great racing experience
