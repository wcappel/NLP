I purchased this to use in my LG VX8100 mobile phone.  I have used it for MP3's and has been working fine.  I initially had some problems with playing the MP3's but found that Verizon had the MP3 setting turned off on the phone.  Once I corrected this, the Mini SD has been working fine.  Only once I had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the LG not the Mini SD card.  No problems since
