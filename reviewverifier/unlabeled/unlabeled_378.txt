This item gives wireless capability to Clie users, and it's the only option if you dont have a wireless integrated handheld.
It is compatible with the models PEG-TJ27, PEG-TJ35, PEG-TJ25, PEG-UX40, PEG-TG50, PEG-NZ90, PEG-NX70V, and PEG-NX60.
The WLAN card works great and I recomend this for every Clie user who wants to go wireless
