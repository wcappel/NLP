CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around
