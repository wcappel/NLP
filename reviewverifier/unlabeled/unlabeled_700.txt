My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue.

Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break.

Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech. That never broke on me
