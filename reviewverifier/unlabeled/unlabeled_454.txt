When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I  didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects:

-Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable)
-Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel
-Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to)
-A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance
-The ability to play video
-A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time
-Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it
-Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players
-Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music.
-Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software
-Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3s 

There are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however:

-The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these.
-Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews. 
-No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.)

This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect.
