This unit is my 2ed UPS made by APC.  I out grew the other and decided on this unit. The USB connection is what sold me on this as I leave my computer on most of the day.  It did shut down (using the included software) during a test I ran and the software as gives you a battery charge state.  A must have if you are in an area that has frequent power problems.  With the built in surge protection, you can't go wrong
