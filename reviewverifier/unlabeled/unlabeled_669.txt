EXCELLENT IMAGE FOR LITTLE MONEY!

I bought the Infocus X2 to replace a worn out and broken $15,000.00 "high end" CRT projector. My budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement. While the X2 could never satisfy the true videophile, who usually spend anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000 dollars on a projector, it was never intended to.  

That being said, I will say that the Infocus X2 when being shown on my Stewart 100" screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the $15,000 unit it replaced!  A true videophile will certainly see the difference, but your average person will not. With my limited budget, I am quite satisfied with the very good image quality.  DVDs are sharp and clear, TV is quite satisfactory also. 

If you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market, and you don't want to spend more than a thousand dollars, here you go! 

But seriously folks, even though it works, stop shining your projector on a wall....  get yourselves a screen. There are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall doesn't have to really bring your image to life.
