Bought this about two months ago. Never liked it for two reasons:
-The rubber cap is so easy to lose. (Guess that's why it comes with spares though.)
-Utterly slow! This is what was most uncomfortable with the drive. Yeah it's slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said. Still, it's annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive. Then unzip when you want to use/copy them. Not practical.

And now, well, it just stopped working last week. I mean completely, for no reason. Just great. Like one day before I was going to sell it to someone else.

Stay away from this one
