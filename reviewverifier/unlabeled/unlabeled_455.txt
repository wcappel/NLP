I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat.  This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.  Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good.
