  I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex
