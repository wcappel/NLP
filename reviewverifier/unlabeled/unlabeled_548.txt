I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes. 
One thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode. I use a 24" Dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and I was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration. Wacom definitely did their homework. 
To be honest I found it to not be that useful in 3D Max, but in Photoshop it's a WMD
