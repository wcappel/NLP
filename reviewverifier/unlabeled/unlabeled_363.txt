If you do a lot of photo retouching, the Graphire4 will give you a lot more control than a mouse.  The pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking. The lighter you press, the less dense the mask is.  It allows you to "paint" in the correction/effect.  

The absolute mode (location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you touch/move the pen) of the pen takes a little while to get used to and I still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse.  But after a minute or so of using it, it comes pretty easily.  I think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet.

It's fun to use too
