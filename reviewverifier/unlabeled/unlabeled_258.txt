I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with.

So I tried X-Fi, only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality. When I put it with Z-5500, I can't believe the quality it delivers. I'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell. Some people complain about no optical output on XtremeMusic and no DDL on the whole X-Fi line. But you really don't need to. Man, the quality from 3 stereo cables at X-Fi is way better than optical output from Montego. This is when I reallized that for audio products, you need listening to compare, instead of looking (the spec) to compare. XtremeMusic should be good for most people but I still bought Platinum version for future proof anyway. In my value, not quality, oriented mind, I still vote for Creative this time. Creative beats Turtle Beach this time. Beats it really hard.

Of course, the microphone is fixed too
