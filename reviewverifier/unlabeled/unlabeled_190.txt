Just purchased this Sony CD alarm clock and I have to say most reviewers are right on target. While it has superior sound quality and features than the competition, the rear light is very bright and the clock display is almost impossible to read from more than a few feet away. I placed a piece of electrical tape over the rear light unit to dampen the brightness and have decided to keep my 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock plugged in next to the new one so I can see the time display off the old one from my bed. Still a satisfactory buy, because the competition produces hard to work,poor sounding crap
