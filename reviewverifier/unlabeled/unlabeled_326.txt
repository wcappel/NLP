When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before.  The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home.  After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods.  In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!  What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable.  I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product
