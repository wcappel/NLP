Dear Seller, 
The price was good, 
The product was good,
Your delivery was excellent!
But it did not come with even a sample of what it can do!
So what now? I plugged it into my computer, and everything loaded as it usually does, but no games, not even a starter edition.
pardon my ignorance, but even when I registered with Logitech, there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device.
Confused new gamer ( I bought this for my five year old, who is as mystifyed as I am).
This product is NOT a recommend for the novice, such as myself.
Just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included....save time and disappointment.
