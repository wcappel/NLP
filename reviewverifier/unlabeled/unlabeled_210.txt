This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
