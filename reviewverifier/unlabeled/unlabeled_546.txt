This product is wonderful. I have had it for about a month and use it with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Corel Painter IX and it still amazes me. In my research, I saw that many people were purchasing the 6x8 size (maybe for price), however, if you have a widescreen format monitor, like myself, you will be much happier with the 6x11. Once you are over the short learning curve, you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use
