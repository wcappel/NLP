It's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have CD players capable of playing MP3 CD's - apparently, the industry has decided that most people don't want this feature in their CD boombox (they must assume people get their MP3 fix from iPods and similar devices).  But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose.  And the cassette player/recorder is also handy if you want to tape from your MP3 CD (or any CD, or the radio) for the benefit of those you may know who still haven't gone to CD yet (there are still a few of those out there as well).  Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks.

First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries.  This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs.  Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode).

The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track).  Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view.

The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between.  I found no problem with the modes available, and find that this is doing the job I needed it to do just fine
