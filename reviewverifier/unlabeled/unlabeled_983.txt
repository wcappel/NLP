Considering the Logitech website states that this product isn't available until Oct.31st, I don't know why people are ancy.  Mine came 3 weeks ahead of Amazon's estimate.

ANYWAY...  Phenomenal build quality, largest diameter wheel available, and sturdy pedal base are among the highlights.  The shifter unit feels flimsy, but as long as you don't overdo it, it should last.  Its still just cool enough that they were able to pack in a gated shifter with a sequential option.  I've played rFactor, GTR2 and Richard Burns Rally with the wheel and the feedback is awesome.  GTR2 probably does it the best.  If you're ready to step up from consumer wheels, and you can't afford the prosumer BRD and ECCI stuff, I don't think you'd be disappointed with this
