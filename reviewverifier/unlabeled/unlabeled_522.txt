I tried two different devices before this one, and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed FM band.

DLO Transpond is excellent, I drive through Sao Paulo, Brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many FM stations in the dial. Occasionally I need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever I have to drive.
Mounting was simply, I use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location.
In short, I am totally satisfied.
