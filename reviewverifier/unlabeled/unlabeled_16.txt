We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco.  It is possible that the newer "D" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode.  We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder.  When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room.  It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful.  I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all.  Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again
