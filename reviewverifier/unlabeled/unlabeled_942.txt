I purchased two ten packs of Lenmar batteries.  Of the twenty batteries, only 4 would take a charge.  I used 3 different chargers, an Energizer, LaCrosse, and a RipVan100.  The LaCrosse is a high-end charger with diagnostics (can display voltage levels, etc., individually for each battery, it can also 'repair' batteries maximum capacities, etc. - so can the RipVan100)...  None could charge the 16 faulty batteries.  I sent both 10 packs back
