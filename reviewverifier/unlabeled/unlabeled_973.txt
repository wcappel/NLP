Hi,
I'm a TomTom addict.  I've been addicted ever since I first plugged in my TomTom 300 and found a new way to work.  Ever since, I've relied on my tomtom to get me from point A to point B.
The user interface is easy to use, intuitive and clever and allows me to find nearby restaurants, hotels or even train stations nearby.
My tomtom is so great, I've even let friends borrow it at work when they have a meeting with a client they have never been to before.
There are some problems: anytime I find my way somewhere using my TomTom, I can't find my way home without the Tomtom.  That's why I'm addicted.
It's reduced my frustration in the car and made me really happy.
Thanks TOMTOM.
Your friend,
NEver Lost Dre
