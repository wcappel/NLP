Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUT

flimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs).  Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong.  Ruined my impression of JVC.

Remember the wisdom "you get what you pay for". . .
