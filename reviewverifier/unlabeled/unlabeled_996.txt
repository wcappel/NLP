I have to agree with other posters here who praise the sound, but can't stand the bright blue lights.  

Performance:  GREAT! It made the stock speakers in my ten year old Corolla sound absolutely amazing.  Much better than the much more expensive Pioneer I installed in another vehicle a couple of years ago.  Likewise the controls on the Dual are straightforward and easy to use.  With the Pioneer, I had to get the manual out whenever I wanted to do something as simple as setting the clock.

No way to dim those damn blue lights, though.  They are so bright that you can't see the AC/HEAT control illumination at night.  I tried the trick of taking off the buttons, but couldn't get them out, so I guess I'm stuck with that.
