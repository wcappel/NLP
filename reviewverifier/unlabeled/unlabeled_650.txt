I bought this stereo for my baby's room. I needed something unobtrusive, with decent sound and that didn't break the bank. This fit the bell just perfectly.

And just in case you're wondering - this unit is almost EXACTLY the same as the $20 cheaper MCM235. The only difference is that the MCM240 can play MP3 CDs whereas the MCM235 cannot. Both, however, will play CD-R and CD-RWs.

The speakers can be mounted directly on the center unit and the whole system can be hung alone, or the speakers can be separated. However, when the speakers are separated, they cannot be hung on the wall themselves because there is no screw latch on the back of the speakers.
The speaker cords are long enough for most placements. If you decide to have the speakers mounted on the unit then you will pleased to know that there is a special place for the cords to be hidden behind the main unit. The only visible cord will be that of the electric plug.

It plays CDs and MP3 CDs (on CD-R or CDRW) well, and the sound was crisp and detailed.

The remote control is about the size of the iPod Nano (but a little wider). The buttons are rounded - but here's the first deficiency - the keys are NOT backlit. Until you can memorize the placement of the keys, you will not be able to use the remote in the dark.

There is a blueish backlit display on the center console. It displays the track being played, or the radio station in tune or, in standby mode, the time. Here's the second deficiency - the display can only be read when viewed head on. I mounted mine a bit too high on the wall, and I can't see what's displayed.

There is a timer feature and a sleep function.

All in all, this is a good system. But even with the caveat that you get what you pay for, the designers could've been a bit more thoughtful in the implementation
