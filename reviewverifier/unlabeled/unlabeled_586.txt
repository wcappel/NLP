I bought the iHome so that I could choose which songs to wake up to off of my iPod, and it worked well when it actually WORKED.  

After being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off I tossed the item - it wasn't worth all of the problems to keep at all if I couldn't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning.  

Other people have mentioned the too bright display and the "gradual volume increase", which I eventually got used to, but I could see how they would be incredibly annoying
