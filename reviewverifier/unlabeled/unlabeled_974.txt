I used it around my city and even took it to Hawaii and it was a lot of help. People forget that the idea of the GPS is to help you find where you are, where you want to go and how to get there but like everything else, it may not be 100% correct -what really is?

What I didn't like about it was the windshield mount broke so it no longer sticks on the windshield.

The biggest thing is that the maps are out-dated. I live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes. Even developments that are 2 years old aren't on the map!

I don't mind paying for updates - I realize that someone has to get paid to update the maps - but I will not pay several hundred dollars to buy a whole new set of maps
