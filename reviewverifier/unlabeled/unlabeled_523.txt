The DLO transpod works perfectly with no static.  I was hesitant to purchase this.  I thought because it works through the radio, there would be some interference or static.  Well, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised.  I was so pleased with this product, I purchased one for my husband, and my sister and two friends bought one too.  For anyone who has an ipod, this is a must have!  Another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it.  I have NEVER needed to charge my ipod.  You can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle.  It takes up very little space.  This product is definitely money well spent, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod
