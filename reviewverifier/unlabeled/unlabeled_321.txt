This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months.  I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response.  They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement.  I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them).  

   I never expected such great customer service.  The new drive is working fine, so hopefully that was just a bad batch
