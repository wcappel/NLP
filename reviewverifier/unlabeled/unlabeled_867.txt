I've had this drive for a year now and I've burned over 500 dvds. The drive is still going strong, with no signs of giving up. I've had a total of 4 coasters and they've always been the fault of the blank dvds, not the drive itself. Never had compatibility problems with DVDs or CDs and I've even used some manufactured/burned overseas. Memorex, TDK, Fujifilm, Sony, you name it and I've burned it.
If you're looking for a dependable, good performance, cheap drive, look no further
