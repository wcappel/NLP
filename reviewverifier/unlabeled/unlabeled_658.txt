I have been in the computer industry for well over 20 years and I have used just about every graphics tablet there is over that period.  I recently had a need to get a new one for my own personal use and I got this Intuos3 9x12 and it is one nice piece of equipment.

No Batteries, no power cords just a short USB cable to the computer.  And it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work.

I have no complaints what so ever; My Mouse works perfectly I am even using it to play Links2003 (Golf).  Don't expect to drop strokes right off the bat, it will take a round or two to get used to the "swing" just like any new "Club" would.  However I would not consider using it for any fast action games; only smooth steady strokes, billiards, golf, etc

In short, everything I expected and more.  I love this Table
