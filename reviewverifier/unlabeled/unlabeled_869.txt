All this has been said before but here it is again. Sony 1-8x DVD+R's with "AccuCORE" will burn at 16x. TDK 8x will only burn at 8x. Wherever you buy this buy it OEM. Save the money for a better version of Nero Burning ROM. Bundled retail software is junk. I've had mine for months now and burned most every format on DVDs and Cd's. No coasters. It's quite but you can here it run. It has a busy light. If it's on it's busy. Firmware updates for media are readily available. Present version is 1.06. You can buy this under $50 and it works great with my AMD 1.4Ghz and Windows 98SE.
