I rarely write reviews but I could not believe what I saw with the "24 DVD" players and it doesn't work.  All I ever use are Verbatim DVD's and I burn on both a Mac and a Windows-based unit.  The Windows DVD's play fine in my Mac and vice-versa.  Also, I have two Sony DVD players, a PS2, and my roomies Zenith DVD player, none of which have a problem playing the discs.  If you "truly" had problems with 24 DVD players, I am wondering if you just got a bad disc.  I have been burning copies of my older DVD's, this weekend alone having done 7, with not a coaster.  On my 2nd 50 pack in under a month, and only have had one problem (which was my fault anyhow).  Verbatim's, in my opinion, are the best media available, in both DVD-R and DVD DL
