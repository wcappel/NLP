The advantage of this surge protector-power strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board. I actually had a modem blow out due to a surge, and it came through the telephone line. Now I use a tel-surge protector so I don't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing. Note that most surge protectors (baring the kind with huge capacitors) cannot protect against lightning hits, but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common, especially in summer, and these devices can help
