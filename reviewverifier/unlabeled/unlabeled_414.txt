I am a photographer whop purchased this for use in Photoshop.  It exceeded my expectations, and continues to amaze me daily.  I now use it for everything from my Safari Browser and iTunes to games.  It is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications!
It is by far the most innovative product I have ever used...and the Tooldial software it comes with is AWSOME!
