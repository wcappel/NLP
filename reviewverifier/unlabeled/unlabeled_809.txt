I rarely write a review , but I figure I should on this one. First off, the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks. Next, the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds I have, worked fantastic... although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first. Anyhow, I also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd's. My only problem was with the shipment itself. It came in some square box...I opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on. The plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken. Go figure! They need to work on their shipping skills. Try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks. Other than that, I just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro. I highly recommend. I don't blame Verbatim for the shipping issues... Go for it
