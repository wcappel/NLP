I'll admit after reading some of these reviews I was a little weary of purchasing this unit, but I got it for $32, so couldn't pass it up.  I was replacing a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (wireless B).  

In a nutshell, I followed the instructions to connect the hardware, popped the CD in my "hard wired" desktop PC, took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens (which are totally simple to navigate), enabling WEP along the way.  When I was done, I fired up my laptop (which has built in wireless-G card).  Network was detected immediately... all I had to do was type in the WEP key (which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup) and viola!  Connected at 54 Mbps!!
Awesome.  The setup procedure could NOT have been any easier.  I would recommend this device to anyone that already has a cable/dsl router (with a free port) and simply wants to add (or upgrade) wireless-G connectivity in their home.
