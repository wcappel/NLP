Truely wireless, the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 AA batteries. I don't know yet how long they last. Mine are now two weeks old and still good.  The unit senses when ANY movement passes by.  I live in the country and now I know when someone comes in the yard. Before I wouldn't always hear the car.  Only drawback is that it picks up deer, dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night.  I like this unit.  It serves a purpose for me that other people  may not have, but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me.  The range is said to be 1000 ft.  That is probably correct.  Mine is about 300 ft. fromt he reciever unit and it works great.  The two way "voice" speaker is the icing on the cake. I love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to "get on out of here".  It's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree.  I have less problems with the neighbor's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my' pets now
