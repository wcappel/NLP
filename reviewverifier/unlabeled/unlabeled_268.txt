This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers
