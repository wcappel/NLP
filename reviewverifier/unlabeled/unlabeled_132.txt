I have an EOS Digital Rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade, at first I thought to buy a 1Gb Sandisk memory, but due to the price fall of memory cards I decided to buy the 2Gb card instead. When I inserted the card into the camera, it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in Large/Fine format or 262 in RAW format, that's more than I need even for a one week vacation trip, but if I upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for JPEG+RAW storage.

I may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old 128Mb memory card, about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures.

I have always trusted in SanDisk products and this card is no exception, quality and performance is as good as I expected
