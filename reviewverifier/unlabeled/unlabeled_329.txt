I had a DVD that was scratched during shipping. One repair kit did nothing to help it. I considered using the Skip Dr., but I never cared for what it did to the disks. My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me
