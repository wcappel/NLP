I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box.
