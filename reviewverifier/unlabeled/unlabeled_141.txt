It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.
