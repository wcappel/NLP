I recently installed this unit into my 1995 Geo Prizm after the factory stereo lost its FM capabilities.  Installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter.  I left the speakers from the previous radio in the car...Boston Acoustics 5 1/4" in the front and JBL 6 1/2" in the rear.  AM stations sound like the factory's FM and the FM is so clear that I hear instruments in the music that I didn't hear before.  I must say that the Dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the "loudness," and then it is adequate.  A large part of the problem is the JBL's in the back.  I do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass.  The stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of pre-select stations to program (6 AM and 18 FM)...I don't know what the local/distant feature does in this unit.  It doesn't seem to have an effect.  The CD player is very good...very clear and hasn't skipped when I am gone down bumpy roads and potholes.

There are claims of the brightness of the radio when driving at night...well yes, there is no question about the brightness.  It's a nice blue and it doesn't bother me a bit...as a matter of fact, it is easy to use the radio in the dark because the controls are easily seem and identified.  A weird "feature" about this radio is that when you have it turned off, any button will turn it on...any button!

All-in-all, bang-for-buck, this Dual XDM6820 is worth every penny that I spent on it.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money for a radio in this old vehicle, but I really got my money's worth and more with this purchase
