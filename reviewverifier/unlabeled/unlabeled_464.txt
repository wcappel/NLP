This fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical ho-hum keyboard. The LCD screen is a nice feature (toy) but I find myself rarely using it as most apps and games don't support it. The two USB ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside USB on their towers. It is worth buying for anyone in that situation. The blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but doesn't help much in a truly dark room. The macro keys are plentiful and easy to use.

All-in-all well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard, anyone needing easy access to USB ports and for anyone needing macro keys. People may also want to give the new Vista keyboard from Microsoft a look
