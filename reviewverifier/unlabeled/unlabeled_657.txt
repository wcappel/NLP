Whether or not you are a 2D or 3D artist, this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable. I had an Aiptek 12000U which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date. This Wacom is so much better.

I love the customisation of it. Its fantastic! Only one gripe with it, and it may be just me, but I would love it if you were able to customise the touch strip and buttons to each program - just as you can with the stylus.

Throw your mouse away - this one's a keeper
