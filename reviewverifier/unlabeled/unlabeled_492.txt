Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149..
I love mine... The sound really is great, and the price was AWESOME!  I use mine for DVD's, my TV's regular sound for all TV I watch, and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio/ CD's in surround sound.  
Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers...  I don't know if this helps or not, but I will share- I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit.  I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference, so if you have that whine, make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment.  Mine does not make any noise on standby, or skip at all either.  I am very happy with mine.
