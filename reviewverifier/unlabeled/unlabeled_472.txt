Brilliant images.  Highest quality.  You simply cannot beat this system for the price.  Also, this particular projection TV handles the non-HDTV channels very well - not all HDTV models do this.  The fact is that most channels are not available in HDTV yet, so it's nice to have a high quality TV that can deliver non-HDTV channels to you in a high quality rendering.  This TV does that very well.  Yes it's nothing like HDTV, but all the same they do a fine job with this model
