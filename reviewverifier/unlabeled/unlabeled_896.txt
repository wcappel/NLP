I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money
