I foolishly placed my irreplaceable, $200 DVD in this newly-purchased machine as instructed.
The result was a disaster!  The machine added visible scratches and made playback WORSE, not better.
Suggestion: if you have valuable CDs or DVDs, send them to a professional repair service that uses professional equipment.  Don't mess around with cheap junk
