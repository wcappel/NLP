I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again
