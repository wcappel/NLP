The de-interlacer chip is unneaded as long as you use all progressive sources.

In fact when you input HDTV it uses the same scaler as the X1 and H30 projectors.

The image quality is great.  Just dont try and watch TV on it, you'll claw your eyes out.

I can't push that enough, the projector is awesome, as long as you use NO interlaced sources
