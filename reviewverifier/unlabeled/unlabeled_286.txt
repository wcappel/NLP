If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on
