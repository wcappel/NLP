I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more
