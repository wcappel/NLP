Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery  takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it
