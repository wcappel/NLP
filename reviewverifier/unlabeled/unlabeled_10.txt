This product is a great deal.  The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination.  Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well!  They will use up about 10 CD's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard cd-cases or 200 thin ones.
