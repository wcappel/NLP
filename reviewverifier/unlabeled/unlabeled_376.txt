I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.

#1 There is no case for the card.
#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1
#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.

Otherwise its a great little expansion card
