This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price
