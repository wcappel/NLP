The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).

The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  

Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)

As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...

I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
