i was using the tape player for my ipod.  but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter.  i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency.  i was very very disappointed.  it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease.  i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear.  so i blame the transmitter.  i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it.  i'm glad target took it back.
