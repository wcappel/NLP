I've been using the 9x12 for a few months now and I have been very happy with the product's improvements over the Intuous 2 line. I love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap--the Intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse, which should be among the most accurate mice available, suffers  from awful jitter. I am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two. 

Still a very good pen tablet, but the mouse part needs work
