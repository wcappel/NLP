This reader (and writer) is absolutely fantastic! I bought this after returning the Biostar 6 in 1 reader from Newe*g. That unit would not read two SmartMedia units I had but the Dazzle knocked it out like a champ. I use it for Compact Flash and SM (4 different brands) and everything works great on the Dazzle. After the rebate the price is hard to beat!
