Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand...
It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8
It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap...
