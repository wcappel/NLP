If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more.

This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do?

It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more "natural soft light" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room.

The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos.
