Wireless is the way to go!
When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place... 

Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech!

Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing...

Still Vibrates
Still Responds Acurately
And the analog sensitivity is better than the wired.

Get it, get it... GET IT!!
