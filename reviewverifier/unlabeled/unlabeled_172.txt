I tried to install the driver on my computer. 

The computer went into a loop, just booting, shutting down, and rebooting. I was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point.

I'm scared to try it again.

Any body want it? I'll sell it cheap. For that matter, just pay the postage and it's yours
