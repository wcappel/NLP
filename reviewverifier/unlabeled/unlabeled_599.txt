I've been using NEATO and the 'MediaFace' software for years.  I LOVE the ability to calibrate the output so I can create 2 sided CD booklets that line up perfectly!  Sure you have to do a little test printing but that's what gives YOU the control.  This is definitely not for the Dumb and Dumber set.  If you want software and label materials that are 'designed with your mind in mind' and don't want creative control, then this is not for you.  I use it for CD booklets, CD labels, and jewel case inserts all on glossy paper and folks think the results are professionally done.  If you don't want to put in the effort, the get something else.  But if you like the freedom to express your creativity, this will give you the room you need
