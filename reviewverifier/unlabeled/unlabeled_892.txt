After reading tons of info, checking critics' recommendations and comparing monitors online, I went to check them out at a CompUSA store.  After seeing some of the monitors and brands the critics like, many of the monitors appeared similar with only vague differences.  Except this Sony.  It outshined all others by a wide margin.  There are two Sony models that have the same frame, so be sure you look at the one with the "XBrite" technology because it's very different.  I have never needed the height adjustment and wires are totally unobtrusive.  This was a plug and play unit, no adjustments were necessary (I changed the pre-sets, but went right back).  So far, after about a month living with this monitor I can't say too many good things about it
