You can never ask for more from this product. 2700maH. That's huge. Runs my discman for weeks (I roughly listen 1 hr everyday). 

The digital display is very good and accurate. The refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products. Now forget about the "memory" bug in your battery.

Given the price, it is worth your while
