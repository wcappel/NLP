One thing I don't like about this clock radio is that it doesn't have a backup battery.  Currently I usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning, but when I do I make sure my Palm PDA is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage.

I tried the weather channels once, and it didn't pick up very well.  I have an older Sony clock radio (that loses time) that I can use for weather that picks up weather just fine.

What makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers.  Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms.  I just push one button several times and it's all set.  I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone.

I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep!

Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be.  All in all a pretty good clock radio, but if you rely on it and don't have a backup, the lack of battery backup is a serious problem
