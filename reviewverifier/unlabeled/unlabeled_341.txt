This controller is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is it wireless, but it corrects my only gripe about the Microsoft S-Controller:

I'm 6'3", and have fairly large hands. I love the layout of the S-Controller, but the "arms" are too short for my hands. This leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions, and ends runs in Forza and Call of Duty long before I'm ready to quit.

The Logitech controller's arms can't honestly be more than a half-inch longer than the S-Controller's, but it makes a world of difference. I highly recommend this controller not only for it's fantastic wireless performance, but for actually being *more* comfortable than the S-Controller.

Another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a memcard/headset slot, and it's a valid complaint. I found the perfect solution in the Logitech Wireless Headset, which can be had here for $20. It works great, and it should be noted that Microsoft still wants $30 for the standard wired headset, which comes with an incredibly-weak clip for the boom mic.

All in all, this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the Xbox. Pair it up with the wireless headset from Logitech, and you have a completely wireless control/chat setup for $50 a pop. You honestly can't do better, for any amount of money
