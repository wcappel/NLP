This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in "hi-fi" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion.
The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening.
