Wonderful picture quality in HD. DVD displays well too. Standard cable signal not really much difference. Would recommend this tv to anyone. Just understand that you need HD programming for this tv to really shine. The audio of this tv is ok, nothing special, but it gets the job done. I have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it
