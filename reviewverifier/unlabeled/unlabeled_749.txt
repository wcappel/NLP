This is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera. I have the OLYMPUS C8080, and at the highest-quality camera settings, I can get 254 color shots from this card. SimpleTech is my favorite brand, because I've never had any of their cards fail on me, even after repeated washings. Oops.

This CF Card is totally dependable. SimpleTech is pricey, but you're paying for quality, which is cheaper in the long run.
