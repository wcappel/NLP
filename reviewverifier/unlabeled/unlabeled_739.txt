I bought this to clean up all of my kids DVDs. They have a ton of discs that are dirty, scratched, etc. I have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one (it was *really* scratched up).

I am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since I have considered this one of my smartest buys this year
